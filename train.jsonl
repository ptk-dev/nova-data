Of the 242 people on board, more than 204 are reported dead. While the cause of the tragic incident is yet to be released, this was the first crash for the Dreamliner, which began flying commercially in 2011.But both Boeing and this particular model have long been embroiled in controversy. Let&rsquo;s go through a timeline of its major issues:All planes grounded: Way back in 2013, all of Boeing&#039;s 50 Dreamliners were temporarily taken out of service by the United States Federal Aviation Administration amid safety concerns over its lithium-ion batteries \u2014 an action rare in its scale.Beacon troubles: Again in 2013, Japan&#039;s All Nippon Airways found damage to wiring on two Boeing 787 locator beacons. Soon after, United Airlines also said that it found a pinched wire during an inspection of one of its six 787s.Fire safety issues: In 2013, once more, Japanese airline ANA Holdings said it had found an electrical wiring problem in the fire extinguishers of the engines of three of its Boeing Dreamliner jets.Quality control: According to a 2019 New York Times investigation, at Boeing&rsquo;s factory near Charleston, South Carolina, where the 787 Dreamliner is manufactured, the company favoured quick production over quality.Production halted: The US Federal Aviation Administration halted 787 deliveries in late 2020 because of production problems. Again in May 2021, safety regulators halted deliveries because they found production flaws in the planes, such as unacceptable gaps between fuselage panels.FAA investigation: In 2024, the US Federal Aviation Administration began investigating claims made by a whistleblower who said that sections of the fuselage of the 787 Dreamliner were improperly fastened together and could break apart mid-flight after thousands of trips. The Boeing engineer, Sam Salehpour, who worked on the plane, said the problems stemmed from changes in how the enormous sections were fitted and fastened together in the assembly line.Losing altitude: In 2024, 50 people were injured on board a Boeing 787-9 flight from Sydney to Auckland after the plane suddenly &quot;dropped&quot; midair. The plane experienced a technical issue, and the flight lost altitude, which threw passengers and crew members into the ceiling.Published By: Pathikrit SanyalPublished On: Jun 12, 2025Tune InMust Watch", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "iyco4u13p98qx22", "date": "2025-06-12 15:26:10.000Z"}}

This edition of the Asia Cup is scheduled to be played in September and India has the hosting rights, but Pakistan will not travel to the neighbouring country as per the hybrid model accepted ahead of the Champions Trophy earlier this year.Therefore, there is a non-clarity surrounding the event, prompting the PCB to initiate talks with the Afghanistan board.&ldquo;With the Asia Cup now unlikely to be held in India as originally planned in September due to the simmering relations between Pakistan and India, the PCB is working on another tri-series proposal,&rdquo; a well-informed source in PCB said.&ldquo;The idea is that if the Asia Cup is moved to the UAE, then Pakistan will play a tri-series with Afghanistan and the UAE in Dubai in August, replacing the Afghanistan tour to Pakistan,&rdquo; he explained.He said the PCB has already been in talks with the two boards to organise the tri-series.&ldquo;If the Asia Cup is cancelled or postponed, the PCB wants the Afghanistan and UAE teams to play the tri-series in Pakistan in August,&rdquo; the source disclosed.PCB Chairman, Mohsin Naqvi is the president of the Asian Cricket Council and the source said the ACC will meet soon to decide on the Asia Cup.&ldquo;The Indian cricket board is yet to confirm its willingness to host the Asia Cup at home.

The opposition parties, who criticised the previous caste census, are now opposing the new caste census. Let them support the original one if they have a problem with the new one,&rdquo; he said.He challenged JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy, BJP state president BY Vijayendra, and senior BJP leader R Ashoka to clarify their stand publicly. &ldquo;Let them call for a press conference and say they support the earlier caste census. They are making many comments, we will respond in the Assembly. The media should highlight these contradictions,&rdquo; he added.The comments come after the Karnataka Cabinet decided to go ahead with a fresh Socio-Economic and Educational Survey, often referred to as the caste census.The decision was based on the recommendations of the Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes, which had submitted its final report earlier this year. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah confirmed that the existing report was outdated, being over a decade old.Asked whether opposition from dominant communities like Lingayats and Vokkaligas influenced the state&rsquo;s decision to redo the survey, Shivakumar declined to comment. &ldquo;This survey will include all communities. Even Kannadigas living outside the state will be able to submit their details online,&rdquo; he said.Clarifying the role of the Congress high command, DK Shivakumar said, &ldquo;They have only given us guidelines.

Of these, 74 had previously lost recognition due to a Calcutta High Court ruling, and have now been reinstated following due procedure. The two new additions\u2014Sadgope and Nepali Brahmin\u2014are being included for the first time.In a politically significant move, the state cabinet, led by Mamata, had a day earlier cleared the inclusion of 76 additional castes to the OBC list. Of these, 74 had previously lost recognition due to a Calcutta High Court ruling, and have now been reinstated following due procedure. The two new additions\u2014Sadgope and Nepali Brahmin\u2014are being included for the first time.Importantly, of the 140 communities currently recommended by the commission for inclusion under OBC categories, 79 belong to Muslim communities and 61 to non-Muslim groups\u2014highlighting that, in terms of sheer numerical representation, the majority of recognised OBC sub-castes in West Bengal remain Muslim.This religious composition has become a flashpoint in the political discourse, with the Opposition BJP alleging that the OBC policy has been meddled with to appease Muslims. In fact, this was the point of contention that led to the cancellation of the previous OBC list.In her address, Mamata pushed back against what she called a &ldquo;baseless&rdquo; campaign. &ldquo;A section is trying to spread the falsehood that our government is giving reservation on the basis of religion. This is completely untrue. The OBC list is not\u2014and will not be\u2014prepared on religious grounds,&rdquo; she said.The WBCBC conducted fresh surveys following a May 2024 Calcutta High Court judgment, which struck down the inclusion of 109 castes in the OBC list, citing procedural lapses. These inclusions, made since 2010 under the previous Left Front government and continued under Trinamool Congress (TMC) rule, were invalidated as they did not meet judicial standards for evidence-based backwardness. The ruling was a significant setback to the state government&rsquo;s affirmative action framework.Mamata clarified that the state government has challenged the high court ruling in the Supreme Court and, with the apex court&rsquo;s permission, resumed the process of inclusion based on new data. &ldquo;The Supreme Court gave us three months to prepare a fresh list. The commission carried out field-level socio-economic surveys, and based on that, we compiled a revised list of 140 communities\u201449 in Category A (more backward) and 91 in Category B (less backward),&rdquo; Mamata said.Detailing the ongoing work, Mamata said surveys were underway for another 50 communities. According to sources, among these 50, 41 are very small in terms of population size, seven are newly applying classes, and two are undergoing re-survey. The chief minister said the aim was to complete the process before the Supreme Court&rsquo;s deadline.She also emphasised the empirical and scientific nature of the methodology. &ldquo;The WBCBC has done a meticulous job. We categorised communities into OBC-A and OBC-B based on the depth of backwardness. The more deprived sections have been placed in Category A, which is entitled to 10 per cent reservation. Those relatively less backward are in Category B, which has 7 per cent reservation,&rdquo; Mamata explained.The revalidation of OBC status, she added, is critical for restarting halted recruitment processes in various government departments and educational institutions. &ldquo;As soon as the list is finalised, we can move ahead with pending recruitments,&rdquo; she told the legislative assembly.However, the Opposition, particularly the BJP, was quick to push back. Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari attempted to respond to Mamata&rsquo;s statement, but assembly speaker Biman Banerjee adjourned the House before he could speak, prompting BJP legislators to erupt in protest.&ldquo;The chief minister was unwilling to take questions from the Opposition. The ruling party essentially fled the House because they know Hindus are being deprived. We will continue our fight for justice,&rdquo; Adhikari told the media outside the assembly.Accusing the state government of communalising the reservation process, he said: &ldquo;I challenge the chief minister to publish the full list of the newly added castes. Let people see for themselves how many are from Hindu backgrounds and how many are Muslim. The BJP will be a party to the case in the Supreme Court, which is scheduled for hearing on July 15, and we will defend the interests of Hindu backward communities.&rdquo;The state government maintains that all documentation, data and evidence used in determining eligibility have been placed before the assembly. &ldquo;This process has followed all legal and procedural norms. Religion has no role here,&rdquo; Mamata reiterated.The political stakes are high. With the 2026 assembly polls looming, the TMC&rsquo;s recalibration of OBC classifications and the BJP&rsquo;s sharp counteroffensive point to a deepening battle over identity, welfare and the arithmetic of electoral mobilisation. For now, the debate is likely to intensify both in the courtroom and on the campaign trail.While, there would still be questions from BJP lawmakers regarding the authenticity of the list\u2014since the majority of the classes classified so far are still Muslims\u2014the WBCBC claims to have followed due process. &ldquo;There is evidence that proves that all these Muslim communities live in poverty and are extremely backward,&rdquo; a source in the government said.Subscribe to India Today MagazinePublished By: Mansi Published On: Jun 12, 2025", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "3843202x34e945f", "date": "2025-06-12 14:30:05.000Z"}}

While no figures have been officially released yet, many are feared dead.As many on social media shared photos and videos of the crash site, some also began sharing a video, allegedly shot moments before the tragic incident. The video shows passengers inside a plane, with one of them filming the view outside. Moments later, the plane appears to lose control, causing panic among the passengers. The video likely ends with a crash, as flames and smoke are visible.Sharing the video on X, one person wrote, &ldquo;Heartbreaking: A Facebook Live video has surfaced reportedly moments before the tragic plane crash near Ahmedabad, Gujarat involving Air India flight AI171.

It is unrelated to the recent Air India incident.OUR PROBEReverse-searching the keyframes of the viral video led us to the same video shared online in January 2023, making it evident that the video is unrelated to the recent Air India plane crash. The post claimed that it showed a plane crash that occurred in Nepal.We then found several news reports about the incident. According to a video report by Mojo Story, the footage was shot inside a Yeti Airlines flight that crashed in Pokhara, Nepal, on January 15, 2023. Yeti Airlines flight 691, which departed from Kathmandu&rsquo;s Tribhuvan International Airport on January 15, crashed into the Seti River gorge, located between the old and new airports in Pokhara, a popular resort city. More than 70 people, including five Indians, died in the crash.Thus, it is evident that an old and unrelated video from a 2023 Nepal plane crash is being falsely shared as footage of the recent Air India crash.(Written by Abhishek Pathak)Published By: Pathikrit SanyalPublished On: Jun 12, 2025Tune InTrending Reel", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "h6ttw05k22e6ziu", "date": "2025-06-12 12:42:59.000Z"}}

{"instruction": "Does the article content match the title?", "input": "Title: Boeing 787 Dreamliner is flawed: Whistleblower sounded alarm early on\nContent: In 2024, Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour raised serious concerns about the structural integrity of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. He alleged that the American aircraft manufacturer took shortcuts while manufacturing the aircraft model&#039;s fuselage and warned it could lead to catastrophic failures over time. Following that, the US Federal Aviation Administration launched an investigation into the same.Almost a year later on Tuesday, an Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, operating as Flight AI171 from Ahmedabad to London, crashed shortly after take-off from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport. The aircraft, carrying 242 passengers and crew, plummeted into the city&#039;s Meghani Nagar area, killing more than 200.The cause of the Air India crash is now under investigation by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and there is no initial evidence linking it to the concerns raised by Salehpour. However, the tragedy has reignited scrutiny of the celebrated wide-body jet, the 787 Dreamliner, and the company Boeing itself.Boeing Airplanes, in its statement on the Air India crash, said that it was &quot;in contact with Air India regarding Flight 171&quot;, adding it stood &quot;ready to support them&quot;.&quot;Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected,&quot; the aircraft manufacturer said in the statement on Tuesday.The crash in Ahmedabad marks the first fatal accident involving a 787 since its commercial debut in 2011.WHISTLEBLOWER WARNED OF STRUCTURAL FLAWS IN 787 ASSEMBLYSalehpour, an engineer at Boeing for over a decade, in January 2024, claimed that improper fastening of fuselage sections during assembly posed risks to the aircraft&#039;s longevity. He claimed that the flawed manufacturing could potentially cause it to break apart mid-flight after thousands of trips.His allegations, detailed in interviews with The New York Times and a formal complaint to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), prompted an ongoing FAA investigation into the 787&rsquo;s production processes.Salehpour&#039;s red flag also extended to Boeing&#039;s 777 jets.The whistleblower alleged that the gaps in fuselage joints and excessive force used to align parts, could lead to premature fatigue in the aircraft&#039;s composite materials.Salehpour&#039;s 2024 complaint detailed how Boeing&#039;s assembly process for the 787 involved forcing misaligned fuselage sections together, sometimes with workers physically jumping on parts to align them.&quot;I literally saw people jumping on the pieces of the airplane to get them to align... By jumping up and down, you&#039;re deforming parts so that the holes align temporarily... and that&#039;s not how you build an airplane,&quot; Salehpour was quoted as saying by CNN.He warned that these shortcuts, affecting over 1,000 Dreamliners, could compromise the aircraft&#039;s safety, which was designed to withstand long-term flight stresses.The FAA had previously investigated similar issues, halting 787 deliveries for nearly two years starting in 2021 due to gaps in fuselage joints.Boeing claimed that it had addressed these concerns, adding that the planes were safe and claimed that extensive testing showed no immediate safety risks.However, Salehpour&#039;s attorneys argued that the FAA was surprised to learn the gaps persisted, and he faced retaliation, including a transfer to the 777 program, where he identified similar issues.Boeing denied these allegations, and showed its confidence in the 787&#039;s safety, saying the physical manufacturing changes would have &quot;no impact on the durability or safe longevity of the airframe&quot;, the New York Times reported in April 2024.Boeing spokesman, Paul Lewis, then said the company had done extensive testing on the Dreamliner and was &quot;determined that this is not an immediate safety of flight issue&quot;.737 MAX&#039;S DOOR PLUG BLOWOUT ADDED TO BOEING&#039;S SAFETY WOESConcerns with the 787 and 777 came to light amid broader safety issues at Boeing, most notably involving its 737 Max jets.The 737 Max was grounded worldwide from March 2019 to December 2020 after two fatal crashes, Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which killed 346 people. The move was linked to flaws in the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) of the aircrafts.Later in January 2024, the 737 Max 9 faced another grounding after a door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight. It further exposed the ongoing quality control issues at Boeing.These incidents, combined with whistleblower claims like those of Salehpour and the late John Barnett, who raised concerns about Boeing&#039;s South Carolina plant before his mysterious death in 2024, fuelled distrust in Boeing&#039;s manufacturing practices.The American manufacturer has since faced FAA restrictions, a leadership overhaul, and a criminal investigation by the Justice Department.Published By: Priyanjali NarayanPublished On: Jun 12, 2025Must Watch", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "80f3r320uuj31en", "date": "2025-06-12 13:08:28.000Z"}}

However, today they don&rsquo;t make the cut. Modern day gifts that involve relaxation, grooming and self-care are trending this season.&ldquo;Dads deserve the same pampering and glow-up moments that moms get. Whether he&rsquo;s a corporate warrior, a hands-on dad, or a retiree enjoying the good life, bespoke skin and hair care treatments help him look and feel his best,&rdquo; says Namika Kant, technical expert at the Mumbai-based Envi Salons.

The mission, which would mark India&rsquo;s return to human spaceflight after 41 years, was originally scheduled for June 11, 2025, but now faces an indefinite delay as Nasa, Axiom Space, and Isro prioritise crew safety and technical validation.Nasa and Axiom Space announced the postponement after a new pressure signature was detected in the aft segment of the ISS&rsquo;s Zvezda service module, following recent repairs. Cosmonauts aboard the station conducted thorough inspections, sealed potential leak points, and measured the current leak rate. While the segment is now holding pressure, Nasa and Roscosmos are taking extra time to ensure the integrity of the module before clearing any new missions to dock. Simultaneously, SpaceX engineers discovered a liquid oxygen (LOx) leak in the propulsion bay of the Falcon 9 rocket during routine pre-launch testing. Liquid oxygen is a critical component of the rocket&rsquo;s fuel system, and even a minor leak can pose significant risks during launch. SpaceX and ISRO teams have decided to repair the leak and conduct additional validation tests before setting a new launch date.The Axiom-4 crew \u2014 led by former Nasa astronaut Peggy Whitson, with Shukla as pilot, and mission specialists Sawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski of Poland and Tibor Kapu of Hungary \u2014 will eventually launch aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Nasa officials have emphasised that there are multiple launch windows available through June and July, but a new date will only be announced once all safety concerns are resolved. This cautious approach highlights the complexities and high stakes of human spaceflight, especially as commercial and international partnerships expand the frontier of space exploration.Published By: Poorva JoshiPublished On: Jun 12, 2025Tune InMust Watch", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "r7da73br89u5702", "date": "2025-06-12 14:32:09.000Z"}}
{"instruction": "Does the article content match the title?", "input": "Title: &#039;In Between the Blurry Lines&#039;, a clearer view of Arunachal Pradesh\nContent: In Between the Blurry Lines: 14 Defining Moments That Shaped Arunachal Pradesh, by Sonam Chombay, is a deeply insightful and timely contribution to add to India&rsquo;s understanding of one of its most critical frontier states\u2014Arunachal Pradesh. At a time when the People&rsquo;s Republic of China continues to assert its unfounded territorial claims by renaming places in the state, this book becomes not just relevant but essential reading.Chombay&rsquo;s narrative comes from a place of lived experience, institutional knowledge and scholarly inquiry, which makes it stand apart from most existing literature on the region.Chombay, a career civil servant from Tawang\u2014epicentre of the geopolitical conflict between India and China\u2014offers a rare blend of insider understanding and outsider training. Having worked extensively in Arunachal Pradesh for over a decade, Chombay&rsquo;s grasp of the state&rsquo;s political, administrative and socio-cultural fabric is layered and unique.In Between the Blurry Lines is arguably the first comprehensive attempt to document the modern history of Arunachal Pradesh, framed through 14 pivotal events, starting from the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation of 1873. This regulation, which introduced the Inner Line, was supposedly to protect the indigenous tribes.However, as Chombay narrates, its geopolitical intent was also to restrict influence from rival European powers like the Italians, Germans and French\u2014and even from Indian mercantile communities such as the Marwaris and Bengalis. The undefined &lsquo;Outer Line&rsquo; and the later attempt to demarcate it through the McMahon Line form the genesis of the contested frontier with China.What makes the book especially compelling is Chombay&rsquo;s ability to examine old narratives with a critical lens. In the concluding epilogue, he questions whether the Inner Line regulation, often justified as a protective measure, has outlived its utility from the perspective of the indigenous population, who now seek development while preserving their traditions. The clarity and empathy in this question are also an internal query the author is grappling with.The book is filled with fascinating and historical anecdotes. The story of Bob Khathing establishing Indian administration in Tawang &lsquo;without firing a single shot&rsquo; is a tale of diplomatic finesse and administrative bravery that deserves wider recognition. Equally moving is the story of Tashi Gombu, a Brokpa yak-herder who became an Indian Army guide during the 1962 war and was later captured by the Chinese People&rsquo;s Liberation Army (PLA). His courage was eventually recognised by the government of India, and Chombay gives his story the space it deserves.The post-1962 period in Arunachal&rsquo;s integration is also explored with great depth. The cultural role of organisations like Vivekananda Kendra and Ramakrishna Mission in spreading Hindi as a link language and connecting the region to the national mainstream is noted with nuance. The takeaway for the reader is that integration was not just a military or administrative but a nation-building effort.Chombay also examines how the Indian state viewed governance in frontier areas\u2014initially governed as NEFA (North-East Frontier Agency) under the ministry of external affairs following Verrier Elwin&rsquo;s philosophy of minimal intervention, then shifted under the ministry of home affairs, and finally given statehood, as a balancing act when Mizoram was being granted the same. These transitions are not just administrative; they reflect how the state&rsquo;s strategic value was understood and acted upon.The book is candid in pointing out the inconsistencies in the Indian state&rsquo;s developmental approach to Arunachal Pradesh. From years of neglect to L.K. Advani&rsquo;s admission in 2003 of a &ldquo;historic blunder&rdquo;, there is a clear turning point. The narrative traces the change from Dr Manmohan Singh&rsquo;s special economic package to the current infrastructural thrust under Narendra Modi, culminating in the inauguration of the state&rsquo;s airport. The symbolic naming of the airport after &lsquo;Donyi-Polo&rsquo;\u2014the Sun and Moon revered by the indigenous people\u2014links the state&rsquo;s development with its civilisational ethos.The narrative of the book does demand patience from the reader at times. Certain chapters are dense, demanding reflection and re-reading; it is a reflection of the layered complexity of the subject. Many chapters could occasion standalone books, and yet, Chombay has managed to weave them into a coherent chronicle.In Between the Blurry Lines is a must-read for anyone who seeks to understand the historical, cultural and strategic significance of Arunachal Pradesh. It goes beyond the limited frameworks of academic discourse, and invites the reader to engage with the richness of a border state that has long lived in the shadow of geopolitics but is finally beginning to clear the blurry lines.Subscribe to India Today MagazinePublished By: Mansi Published On: Jun 12, 2025Must Watch", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "2x880a3ydp4nv9o", "date": "2025-06-12 14:39:38.000Z"}}

Mike Blake | ReutersEven retail executives are bullish on the \"TACO trade.\"\u00a0Following weeks of shifting trade policy, early deals and winding court challenges, some retail executives are starting to feel more optimistic about President Donald Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs, a new survey from consulting firm AlixPartners shows.\u00a0The survey, which polled executives from brands, retailers and other consumer companies on June 1, found most respondents expect the president will walk back those steep duties on the European Union, Vietnam, India and Mexico after a 90-day pause lapses in July.\u00a0Mexico\u00a0wasn't part of Trump's reciprocal tariffs but has faced new levies from the administration, which respondents also expect will stay the same.Imports from those areas and dozens of other countries are facing a 10% duty as the Trump administration tries to hammer out trade deals with individual nations. Most survey respondents expect those 10% tariffs to remain in effect \u2014 rather than the far higher rates originally imposed on April 2 \u2014 after those negotiations are complete.\u00a0For example, 53% of retail executives expect tariffs on goods imported from Vietnam to stay at 10% after the delay ends, instead of the feared 46% \"reciprocal\" levy that could batter companies like Nike that import a major share of goods from the country.For many retailers, Vietnam has become the next manufacturing frontier outside of China. Negotiations between the southeast Asian country and Washington D.C. have been closely watched, and the subject of many executives' consternation in recent months.\u00a0In the weeks after Trump announced then reduced the steep \"reciprocal\" tariffs, many executives feared they would end up being higher than 10%, said Sonia Lapinsky, a partner and managing director at AlixPartners, citing conversations the firm has had with retail leaders.\u00a0But as June approached, the vibe started to shift, the survey results show.\u00a0For one, the U.S. and China finally came to the negotiating table. Days before the survey was conducted, the U.S. Court of International Trade also ruled that Trump didn't have the authority to impose the April 2 tariffs. While that ruling is on hold pending appeal from the Trump administration, the developments signaled to retailers that the tariffs could be scrapped altogether, the survey results show.\u00a0\"[Trump] is showing that he wants to make a deal, and that took a lot of effort for him to go and get that done at that stage. If we remember, even trying to get a meeting was very difficult for both sides to get done and yet they got progress made,\" said Lapinsky. \"I think the fact that there was some pushback that has since been retracted on allowing the tariffs to go through, I think could make some people feel more confident that potentially that could happen again.\"\u00a0In the days after the survey was conducted, Trump made a preliminary deal with China to maintain a new 30% tariff on imports, after he reduced a previous 145% duty.It's another sign to retail executives that tariffs on the rest of the world could remain at 10%, and shows their views may align with the so-called TACO trade \u2013 a critique coined by a Financial Times columnist that stands for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\"\u00a0The term describes a past pattern where Trump announces high tariffs and then later pauses or lightens them after markets react negatively.\u00a0When asked about the term last month, Trump said it's not about chickening out.\u00a0\"It's called negotiation,\" he said.Still, Lapinsky cautioned that the optimism among retailers could be premature.\u00a0\"We can see that China could be at status quo, because there's been such discussion about the deal making back and forth and the priorities of both countries to get something to work eventually, but these other countries don't have the leverage that China has,\" said Lapinsky.\"Whether they're going to be able to negotiate keeping down a similar deal or not to me remains very unknown,\" she continued. \"I wouldn't have expected that many retailers to say they thought it was going to stay status quo.\"\u00a0While more respondents expect the 10% tariff to remain in place in most regions outside of China, the responsible companies are planning for both, said Lapinsky.\u00a0For example, 46% of respondents expect tariffs on imports from India to stay at 10%, instead of the proposed 26% levy. But 29% of respondents are also planning for both scenarios, where duties either stay the same or end up higher.", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "zd5sc94s7wc6e1j", "date": "2025-06-12 15:28:15.000Z"}}
{"instruction": "Does the article content match the title?", "input": "Title: Here are the three reasons why tariffs have yet to drive inflation higher\nContent: Shoppers browse the frozen food cases at WinCo.Joe Jaszewski | Idaho Statesman | Tribune News Service | Getty ImagesDespite widespread fears to the contrary, President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to show up in any of the traditional data points measuring inflation.In fact, separate readings this week on consumer and producer prices were downright benign, as indexes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that prices rose just 0.1% in May.The inflation scare is over, then, right?To the contrary, the months ahead are still expected to show price increases driven by Trump's desire to ensure the U.S. gets a fair shake with its global trading partners. So far, though, the duties have not driven prices higher, save for a few areas that are particularly sensitive to higher import costs.At least three factors have conspired so far to keep inflation in check: companies hoarding imported goods ahead of the April 2 tariff announcement, the time it takes for the charges to make their way into the real economy, and the lack of pricing power companies face as consumers tighten belts.\"We believe the limited impact from tariffs in May is a reflection of pre-tariff stockpiling, as well as a lagged pass-through of tariffs into import prices,\" Aichi Amemiya, senior economist at Nomura, said in a note. \"We maintain our view that the impact of tariffs will likely materialize in the coming months.\"watch nowThis week's data showed isolated evidence of tariff pressures.Canned fruits and vegetables, which are often imported, saw prices rise 1.9% for the month. Roasted coffee was up 1.2% and tobacco increased 0.8%. Durable goods, or long-lasting items such as major appliances (up 4.3%) and computers and related items (1.1%), also saw increases.\"This gain in appliance prices mirrors what happened during the 2018-20 round of import taxes, when the cost of imported washing machines surged,\" Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, said in his daily market note.One of the biggest tests, though, on whether the price increases will prove durable, as many economists fear, or as temporary, the prism through which they're typically viewed, could largely depend on consumers, who drive nearly 70% of all economic activity.The Federal Reserve's periodic report on economic activity issued earlier this month indicated a likelihood of price increases ahead, while noting that some companies were hesitant to pass through higher costs.\"We have been of the position for a long time that tariffs would not be inflationary and they were more likely to cause economic weakness and ultimately deflation,\" said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. \"There's a lot of consumer weakness.\"Indeed, that's largely what happened during the damaging Smoot-Hawley tariffs in 1930, which many economists believe helped trigger the Great Depression.Tilley said he sees signs that consumers already are cutting back on vacations and recreation, a possible indication that companies may not have as much pricing power as they did when inflation started to surge in 2021.Fed officials, though, remain on the sidelines as they wait over the summer to see how tariffs do impact prices. Markets largely expect the Fed to wait until September to resume lowering interest rates, even though inflation is waning and the employment picture is showing signs of cracks.\"This time around, if inflation proves to be transitory, then the Federal Reserve may cut its policy rate later this year,\" Brusuelas said. \"But if consumers push their own inflation expectations higher because of short-term dislocations in the price of food at home or other goods, then it's going to be some time before the Fed cuts rates.\"", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "702ttvc36r2uoif", "date": "2025-06-12 15:18:42.000Z"}}

{"instruction": "Does the article content match the title?", "input": "Title: My husband and I just bought our first house: 3 things I wish I had known before we started looking\nContent: After over a decade of renting New York City apartments both separately and together, my husband and I made the biggest move of our lives \u2014 both physically and financially.In October 2024, we started looking to buy a place about an hour outside of NYC in Connecticut. At the end of December, our hunt officially ended when we closed on our new house. We moved in mid-January 2025.Now, a few months post-move, with most of our boxes unpacked, I'm feeling settled into our new space and routine and thinking back on how we got here.\u00a0Ultimately, our path to becoming homeowners was pretty smooth, but there are a few things I wish I had known before we even started visiting open houses.\u00a01. 'Casual' might turn serious, quicklyMy husband and I started our hunt on a beautiful, sunny weekend in October. We knew we wanted to buy a house within the next 10 months but wanted to start off slow, by checking out a few houses in the towns we were most interested in to get a sense of the market.On Saturday, we scheduled one tour and stopped by two open houses, discussing the pros and cons of each house on our drives between them.\u00a0On Sunday, after brunch at my sister-in-law's house, we stopped by another open house just a short drive away. The house had been on the market for a few months, so we weren't expecting much.\u00a0Instead, by the time we had walked through the house and chatted with the sellers' agent, we were debating if we should put an offer in. The only issue was that we hadn't prepared for things to go so quickly. We weren't preapproved for a mortgage. We hadn't signed with an agent of our own yet.\u00a0That meant for the next 24 hours or so, we were in scramble mode, getting together all our W-2s and paystubs to get preapproved so we could put in the offer. It all got done, and ultimately our offer was accepted, but planning a little more, even for the most casual stage of house hunting, would have put us in a much more relaxed and ready position.2. Run the numbers \u2014 and then run the numbers againEven if you get your pre-approval before you house-hunt, you may want to take some time getting into the nitty gritty of what your mortgage payment actually means for your wallet. Even after you've taken your mortgage into account, you still need to consider property taxes, utility payments, home insurance and maintenance costs, among others.For instance, don't forget your closing costs, which can include a loan processing fee and insurance fees, among others, usually totaling 3% to 6% of the purchase price. Or that you'll have to pay anyone involved in the transaction of buying the house, whether that's a lawyer, an inspector or a real estate agent.Think about how much you might need to spend transitioning to your new living situation. Will you need to hire movers or rent a U-Haul? Are there any fees associated with breaking your lease?Consider what updates or changes you might have to make to the house before or soon after you move in. Factor in what it might cost to hire painters or how much you may want to spend on new appliances and furniture.\u00a0Even just in the few months since we moved, we've added gutter guards, replaced our fridge and dishwasher, and gotten quotes for exterior painting. That's in addition to buying all the odds and ends that make up regular home maintenance. Those costs really add up \u2014 the fridge and dishwasher together cost over $1,000.Thinking realistically about all those numbers before you sign any mortgage documents will make it easier to determine what you can really afford when it comes to buying a house \u2014 and save you a lot of stress, money and time hunched over budget spreadsheets.3. Rely on your networkLean on the homeowners in your life for advice \u2014 whether that's recommendations for real estate agents, lawyers and mortgage brokers if they live in the area, or advice on how to house-hunt and what to look out for.We were lucky that my sister-in-law and her family bought a house in the same town two years before us. They recommended the real estate attorney they worked with, who in turn recommended the mortgage broker who ended up giving us the best rate.They were also able to give us insight into what living in the area is like \u2014 including information that we wouldn't have found online, like which streets get busy because of slow traffic lights.Buying a house isn't all about who you know, but your network can make it a lot easier.Are you ready to buy a house?\u00a0Take Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course\u00a0How to Buy Your First Home.

The 33-year-old Belgian midfielder, who spent a decade at City, chose the Italian champions as his next destination, linking up with newly appointed manager Antonio Conte.Manchester City confirmed in April that De Bruyne would not be offered a new contract, ending a glittering 10-year spell that saw him win multiple Premier League titles, domestic cups, and the UEFA Champions League. Speaking about his exit, De Bruyne described the club&#039;s decision as purely a &quot;business decision.&quot;Napoli unveiled the signing in dramatic fashion, posting a digitally rendered image of De Bruyne seated on a golden throne wearing a crown, accompanied by the caption: &quot;King Kev is here.&quot; The move is a statement of intent by the Serie A champions, who are looking to strengthen their squad under Conte ahead of their Champions League campaign next season.Despite interest from MLS sides Inter Miami and Chicago Fire, De Bruyne prioritized remaining in top-tier European football. He turned down a lucrative offer from Chicago Fire, opting instead for Napoli to maintain his place at the highest level of competition.De Bruyne made his final appearance for Manchester City as a substitute in their 2-0 win over Fulham on the final day of the Premier League season. Last season, he registered four goals and seven assists in 28 league appearances, continuing to showcase his enduring class despite injuries.With the first of two summer transfer windows now open, Napoli&#039;s acquisition of De Bruyne marks one of the standout moves of the summer so far.

{"instruction": "Does the article content match the title?", "input": "Title: Air India crash: What may have gone wrong? A commercial pilot&#039;s first analysis\nContent: Early analysis of flight visuals from the ill-fated Air India AI171, which crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, has raised serious questions about the aircraft&rsquo;s configuration and possible technical malfunctions during its final moments.Visual analysis indicates that as the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner departed, its landing gear remained extended and its wing flaps were fully retracted\u2014an extremely abnormal situation for the critical initial climb phase. Standard operating procedure for the 787 calls for flaps to be set at 5 (or higher) for takeoff, then gradually retracted only as the aircraft accelerates and gains altitude.  The landing gear is normally retracted once a positive rate of climb is established, usually within seconds after liftoff and well before reaching 600 feet. Visual evidence shows the landing gear began retracting briefly, but the pilot quickly extended it again, likely realising a loss of thrust or power. The aircraft appeared to suffer a power failure just moments after takeoff.Another plausible scenario is that the landing gear became stuck in the down position, possibly due to a mechanical or hydraulic failure. In such a situation, the crew might have attempted to retract the flaps early to reduce drag and gain speed, as extended gear and flaps together would create excessive drag and severely limit climb performance.  However, retracting flaps too soon at low altitude and low speed is highly risky, as it reduces lift and increases stall risk.Despite these issues, the aircraft&rsquo;s flight path did not show significant yawing or rolling, suggesting the pilots retained some control authority. There is speculation of right rudder input, which could indicate a left engine failure, but this alone does not explain the unusual configuration of gear down and flaps up.In normal operations, both the gear and flaps should not be in these positions at such a low altitude.The combination of extended landing gear and retracted flaps at 600 feet is highly irregular and points toward a possible cascading technical failure or a sequence of emergency actions by the crew in response to a malfunction. The final loss of altitude and apparent stall likely resulted from insufficient lift and excessive drag, leaving the crew unable to recover before impact. Investigators will focus on these anomalies as they analyse flight data and cockpit recordings in the coming days.(Nagarjun Dwarakanth, Editor, South Bureau, India Today TV is a licenced commercial pilot)Published By: Sibu Kumar TripathiPublished On: Jun 12, 2025Must Watch", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "69q56hx6wx06bao", "date": "2025-06-12 11:04:34.000Z"}}

{"instruction": "Does the article content match the title?", "input": "Title: Is toxic weedicide only reason MP govt is refusing to procure moong at MSP?\nContent: A major political row involving farmers has erupted in Madhya Pradesh, with the state government refusing to buy moong at MSP (Minimum Support Price) this year.The MSP for moong this year is Rs 8,682 per quintal, around Rs 1,500-Rs 2,000 per quintal higher than market prices. For the past few years, the state&rsquo;s farmers, especially those along the Narmada in the central region, have been sowing moong as a short summer crop between the major rabi and kharif seasons.The summer moong, sown over 1.2 million-1.4 million hectares, is known to have added to farm incomes in the districts of Narmadapuram, Raisen, Sehore, Vidisha, Jabalpur, Katni, Harda and Narsinghpur.The state government had been procuring the summer moong crop for the past four years. But last week, agriculture production commissioner Ashok Barnwal announced moong won&rsquo;t be purchased as, in his words, it is mostly contaminated with harmful weedicides.What is the role of weedicides in moong cultivation, and is that the real reason why the government decided not to buy it?The summer moong crop is sown in late March-early April as soon as the wheat crop has been harvested. Irrigation is provided through tubewells, or through dams, for which the water resources department especially releases water to support the crop.Moong has a two-and-a-half-month cycle, but farmers are in a hurry to harvest the crop as any delay will cost them dearly in the following kharif season, sowing for which begins in mid-June.It is an open secret that farmers spray moong crop with broad leaf weedicides after seed formation and ripening in the pod, which quickly readies it for harvesting using combines. This saves farmers around 10-15 days at a critical juncture when sowing for the next crop is to be done.But why has the state government woken up to the practice of spraying weedicides, such as Paraquat, now when this has been in practice for years? There is ample material on the health hazards from consuming something treated with Paraquat, widely considered highly toxic. However, the state government has not carried out any lab tests to ascertain the presence of poisonous substances in the moong crop. Also, not all farmers use weedicides for moong.Moreover, Paraquat is not a banned weedicide in India. If weedicides are making moong hazardous, their sale outside the MSP ecosystem should also be curtailed, say observers.So, do the reasons lie elsewhere? Sources in the government said that while chief minister Mohan Yadav is against the use of weedicides on crops, the government also has a financial issue to deal with. Last year, 580,000 tonnes of moong were procured at the MSP of Rs 8,558 per quintal. Of this, the Union government footed the bill for around 330,000 tonnes, as per a limit it had fixed; the balance was left with the MP government to sell in the open market.Moong is not part of the public distribution system. The sale in open market caused a loss of around Rs 1,000 crore last year. It is this amount that the state government may be wanting to save. Besides the state government, the Union government also lost a little more than Rs 1,000 crore in post-procurement sale in the open market.There is huge politics over pricing of farm produce in Madhya Pradesh as agriculture is the main economic activity. The BJP, during the 2023 election, had promised wheat procurement at Rs 2,700 per quintal but is yet to honour it. Its government has also not delivered on the promised paddy procurement prices.While the Opposition Congress has been vocal about the moong procurement issue, the state government seems to be in no mood to oblige. Now, with former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan as the Union agriculture minister, farmers have their eyes fixated on him in the hope of an intervention.Subscribe to India Today MagazinePublished By: Mansi Published On: Jun 12, 2025Must Watch", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "oz1ix90smr8fsyu", "date": "2025-06-12 14:38:01.000Z"}}

Members of the family, including her father-in-law Rajendra Hagawane, mother-in-law Lata, husband Shashank, brother-in-law Sushil and sister-in-law Karishma, have been arrested.Rajendra was a leader of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), led by Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. He has since been expelled from the party. Vaishnavi&rsquo;s parents have charged that their daughter was tortured and beaten up for money by the Hagawanes. They claimed Vaishnavi&rsquo;s in-laws had been given a Toyota Fortuner SUV, cash and gold at the time of the marriage.A series of meetings across Maharashtra, led by members of the Maratha community, have called for an end to ostentatious expenditure during weddings as well as dowry harassment. Senior leaders of the community said the trend of spending lavishly on weddings and gifts had begun a few years ago from rapidly urbanising Pimpri-Chinchwad adjoining Pune, where farmers made crores of rupees by selling their lands to builders and developers. Some of these weddings have a guest-list running into thousands, with a lavish menu, expensive decorations and gifts.Rajendra Kondhare of the Akhil Bharatiya Maratha Mahasangh, who is involved in the effort, said the guidelines include not giving expensive gifts at the wedding, saving on expenses, ensuring that the marriage rites take place on time, and not giving speeches at the wedding. Families have also been asked to ensure that the number of guests is 500 or less. &ldquo;In case of dowry harassment or dowry-related deaths in a family, members of the community will stop &lsquo;roti-beti vyawhar&rsquo; with them (take to social boycott),&rdquo; explained Kondhare.&ldquo;It is those from the middle-class and the neo-rich category who are into this. They try to compete with those above them in the social and economic order and splurge money on weddings. They are also cagey about what society will say about them in case they conduct these ceremonies in a frugal manner,&rdquo; he added.Meetings in this regard have been held in areas like Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Nashik and Parbhani. Kondhare said that members of other communities, such as Gujaratis, Marwaris, and Kumbhars, had also attended these meetings, which have seen presence of politicians and leaders from across party lines and from social organisations like the Maratha Mahasangh and Sambhaji Brigade. Decisions have also been taking on the families of the bride and the bridegroom sharing the expenses between them.Prashant Shitole, former NCP corporator from Pimpri-Chinchwad, said they wanted to promote less expensive marriages. &ldquo;The financial capacity of families differs and so, some are compelled to draw loans for marriages. They feel if they do not conduct their marriage in a lavish manner, they will be criticised by society,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;The families can keep a fixed deposit in the name of the daughter, or donate to institutions or the deserving,&rdquo; added Shitole.Subscribe to India Today MagazinePublished By: Mansi Published On: Jun 12, 2025", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "85xp5rdv4hj9oer", "date": "2025-06-12 14:37:57.000Z"}}

He immediately hid under the table. After a few moments, he saw others fleeing the building.\u201cI ran out too,\u201d Gujjar told Scroll. \u201cWhen we came out, we realised that a plane had crashed on the roof.\u201dOn Thursday, barely a minute after Air India flight AI171 took off from Ahmedabad at 1.38 pm, it crashed down in Meghani Nagar, a densely populated residential area bordering Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International airport.The Boeing 787 Dreamliner was headed for London Gatwick. Of those on board, 169 were Indian nationals, 53 British, seven Portuguese and one was a Canadian national. So far, 204 bodies have been found at the crash site.Gujjar, a second-year medical student at BJ Medical College and Civil Hospital, had walked into the mess at 1.30 pm along with three other students. \u201cA few first-year students were sitting at a table next to ours,\u201d he said.The hostel mess for undergraduate students, a two-storey building, is part of a complex of several buildings housing students and faculty of BJ Medical College in Meghani Nagar.The mess is about 5 km from the international airport. Gujjar said they are used to hearing the boom of aircraft flying overhead every day.\u201cThe noise that we heard today was nothing different,\u201d he said. \u201cPlanes fly very low due to our proximity to the airport. But then there was a loud crash that I could hear from the ground floor/\u201dThe ground floor and the first floor of the mess have a seating capacity of over 300. Gujjar said that while there were about 20 to 25 students on the ground floor, he is uncertain of the number who were on the first floor.The crash was followed by a gas cylinder exploding on the first floor of the mess. The roof of the first floor had come crashing down, which trapped many students, said Gujjar.When they ran out, Gujjar said he saw the tail-end of the aircraft jutting out from the roof of the mess. The rear of the aircraft, he said, crashed on the roof of the mess. The cockpit and half of the front portion of the plane crashed into a six-storey building next to the mess.\u201cThere is a narrow lane separating that building from the mess,\u201d Gujjar said.The six-storey building is the staff quarters for doctors working in the UN Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre, a hospital functioning under the BJ Medical College.The building was also home to the families of the doctors. It is unclear how many people were in the building at the time of the crash. Gujjar said the fuel tank of the aircraft probably exploded when it hit the residential building. The fire gutted the entire six-storey structure.Gujjar said that a few junior students were injured when the ceiling collapsed. He rushed them to the trauma ward.Krish Dabhoya, a final-year student at the medical college, said he left the mess 10 minutes before the disaster. \u201cIf the plane had crashed at 1 pm, the entire mess would have been full and the casualties would have been much more,\u201d he told Scroll. \u201cBy 1.30, several students had left.\u201dDabhoya said many students are feared trapped in the debris on the first floor of the mess. \u201cWe are counting students who live in hostel and checking for missing students,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many who got injured and are being treated.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe building where the doctors live is completely burnt. There was no time to rescue those living on upper floors.\u201dDabhoya suggested that five medical students had died in the crash. Dr Dharmesh Patel, head of the forensic department and deputy dean at the hospital, refused to comment on the number of medical students who died.Students in the hospital lined up to donate blood after the count of the injured rose. Dr Rohan Krishnan, the chief patron of the Federation of All India Medical Association Doctors Association, said it has been difficult to establish the identities of the dead because of burn injuries.\u201cAbout 50 medical students are admitted to the hospital,\u201d Krishnan told mediapersons. \u201cWe need blood to treat them.\u201d\n        \n        \n        \n      We welcome your comments at\n      letters@scroll.in.\n    \n        \n  \n      \n        Boeing\n      \n    \n      \n        Ahmedabad\n      \n    \n      \n        Air India\n      \n    \n      \n        Gujarat\n      \n    \n      \n        Aviation\n      \n    \n\n\n        \n    \n\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "0hd7zciq8o7r1wx", "date": "2025-06-12 15:00:00.000Z"}}
{"instruction": "Does the article content match the title?", "input": "Title: UK: Four myths behind plans to cut low-skilled immigration \nContent: \n        \n          The UK government has outlined plans to reduce low-skilled migration to the country. A central aspect is linking skills and training to the immigration system. This, so the thinking goes, will mean that no industry is able to rely on immigration to fill skills gaps.Research I carried out with colleagues on employer strategies in the wake of Brexit shows that pitting legal routes for migrant workers against investment in the local workforce is based on flawed assumptions.Evidence from sectors historically reliant on migration, such as transport and storage, food manufacturing, hospitality and social care, debunks four myths about migration and the labour market that underpin the government\u2019s immigration plans.Myth 1: migration and trainingUnder-investment in skills by both employers and the state is a long-term issue of the UK deregulated economy. But the idea that employers hire migrants instead of training local workers is, to say the least, contested.Our research shows that migration can benefit workplace learning and incentivise employers to invest in training. We undertook a survey of employers\u2019 practices after Brexit. Firms investing more in training, or seeking diverse workforces, tended also to be those (usually larger firms) that have financial and HR capacity to deal with migration hurdles. For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) especially, this system remains costly and bureaucratic.Previous research showed that employers that hired migrant workers after Brexit were also more likely to invest in the domestic workforce, or in technology. The government should view the recruitment of migrants as \u201csupplementing, not supplanting\u201d the domestic labour force.Myth 2: migrants vs inactive youthThe government\u2019s plans, as well as other narratives, tend to play migrants against NEETs (young people who are not in education, employment or training). This suggests that the growing number of these young people is caused by employers using \u201clow-skilled\u201d migration.Engaging economically inactive people and complying with a workforce strategy that prioritises training local workers are set out as strict conditions for employers hoping to recruit from abroad. Yet the theory of replacing migrants with economically inactive people is a simplistic equation.One main finding of our research is that young people often refuse to work in these sectors because of poor conditions rather than because employers favour migrants. Our survey found that, despite marginal pay increases and other benefits to deal with staff shortages, pay across the four sectors remains benchmarked at the minimum wage.This fuels high staff turnover, intensive work and insecure contracts. These factors often make the jobs unattractive. But by introducing fair pay agreements in the care sector and by financially supporting local authorities and care providers, it should be possible to attract young people.Improving pay and conditions must be a priority, rather than closing the care worker visa, which could be devastating for the sector.Myth 3: temporary migration is a sustainable optionThe government proposes raising the skills threshold and including a \u201ctemporary shortage list\u201d. For occupations with a skills requirement below degree level, employers will be able to use the immigration system only temporarily. This is not a substantive change from the occupational temporary schemes and tweaks to the skilled worker visa by the previous government.Our research shows that allowing migrants entry only through a limited number of schemes has led to the crowding of visa applications into one route (for example, the care worker visa). This contributed to abuse of the system, the proliferation of bogus employers and exploitative practices.Our research with migrant care workers who lost their sponsoring employer highlighted barriers to finding a new sponsor. Only a small number of care providers can guarantee full-time employment.Overall, reactive and temporary visa schemes have proven to be negative for both workers and businesses. This is confirmed by research on seasonal migration in other sectors like agriculture.Only a migration system that allows workers to stay and thrive in their jobs, bring their dependants and build stable lives can reduce labour turnover. This in turn can improve productivity and lead to a long-term workforce strategy.Myth 4: migration damages the economyThe government\u2019s newly unveiled immigration system risks putting the brakes on its plan for growth. Ministers have based their new plan on the assumption that increased net migration damages the UK, referring to the decrease in GDP per capita during the increase in net migration as a measure.But there is plenty of evidence that leaving the European common market and external shocks like the Covid pandemic and war in Ukraine have been the cause of UK economic decline. It recorded one of the largest slowdowns in productivity among the G7 in 2023.In contrast, our research shows that migrants are vital not just in sectors like social care, but also in those considered \u201clow-skilled\u201d by the government. Workers in logistics, hospitality and food manufacturing were treated as \u201cessential\u201d during Covid but soon forgotten and then apparently relegated to \u201clow-value\u201d.Our research calls for a re-evaluation of these foundational sectors, as they represent the backbone of industries considered pivotal by the government\u2019s own industrial growth strategy.For a joined-up approach to be truly effective, employers associations, trade unions and migrant advocacy groups, together with national and local governments must contribute to longer-term migration plans. These should consider industry needs, migrant workers\u2019 wellbeing as well as the viability of public services and other critical sectors affected by stricter migration requirements if numbers continue to decline.Telling firms they need to invest in the local workforce before they can hire from abroad appears blind to the reality. Training is not a quick fix, it requires time and investment from employers and the state. And ultimately, improved pay and working conditions are likely to make these sectors more attractive to the local population.Gabriella Alberti is Professor of International Labour Migration, University of Leeds.This article was first published on The Conversation.\n        \n        \n        \n      We welcome your comments at\n      letters@scroll.in.\n    \n        \n  \n      \n        UK Immigration\n      \n    \n      \n        United Kingdom\n      \n    \n      \n        Labour\n      \n    \n      \n        Brexit\n      \n    \n      \n        Employment\n      \n    \n      \n        Carework\n      \n    \n\n\n        \n    \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n          \n        \n      ", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "40bg46r6ppebm85", "date": "2025-06-12 16:30:00.000Z"}}

The situation escalated when staff members allegedly confined the visitor in an office room, sparking public outrage, the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha reported.On June 10, a group of residents organised a human chain and protest rally near the Kacharibari. During their protest, a group of demonstrators entered the museum premises and vandalised its auditorium, the news agency reported.Bangladesh\u2019 Department of Archaeology formed a three-member committee to investigate the incident and assess damages. It is expected to submit its report within five days.

There were GTC Paris T-shirts on the back of every chair and even a merchandise store.Nvidia GTC in Paris on 11 June 2025Arjun KharpalThe aura of Huang really struck me when, after a question-and-answer session with him and a room full of attendees, most people lined up to take pictures or selfies with him.Macron and Starmer both wanted to be seen on stage with him.Nvidia positions itself as Europe's AI hopeNvidia's key product is its graphics processing units (GPU) that are used to train and execute AI applications.But Huang has positioned Nvidia as more than a chip company. During the week, he described Nvidia as an infrastructure firm. He also said AI should be seen as infrastructure like electricity.His pitch to all countries was that Nvidia could be the company that will help countries build out that infrastructure.\"We believe that in order to compete, in order to build a meaningful ecosystem, Europe needs to come together and build capacity that is joint,\" Huang said during a speech at the Viva Tech conference in Paris on Wednesday.Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, speaks during the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris, France, June 11, 2025. Gonzalo Fuentes | ReutersOne of the most significant partnerships announced this week is between French startup Mistral and Nvidia to build a so-called AI cloud using the latter's GPUs.Huang spoke a lot during the week about \"sovereign AI\" \u2014 the concept of building data centers within a country's borders that services its population rather than relying on servers located overseas. Among European policymakers and companies, this has been an important topic.Huang also heaped praise on the U.K., France and Europe more broadly when it came to their potential in the AI industry.China still behind but catching upOn Thursday, Huang decided to do a tour of Nvidia's booth and I managed to catch him to get a few words on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"A key topic of that discussion was China. Nvidia has not been able to sell its most advanced chips to China because of U.S. export controls and even less sophisticated semiconductors are being blocked. In its last quarterly results, Nvidia took a $4.5 billion hit on unsold inventory.I asked Huang about how China was progressing with AI chips, in particular referencing Huawei, the Chinese tech giant that is trying to make semiconductor products to rival Nvidia.Huang said Huawei is a generation behind Nvidia. But because there is lots of energy in China, Huawei can just use more chips to get results.watch now\"If the United States doesn't want to partake, participate in China, Huawei has got China covered, and Huawei has got everybody else covered,\" Huang said.In addition, Huang is concerned about the strategic importance of U.S. companies not having access to China.\"It's even more important that the American technology stack is what AI developers around the world build on,\" Huang said.Just reading between the lines somewhat \u2014 Huang sees a world where Chinese AI tech advances. Some countries may decide to build their AI infrastructure with Chinese companies rather than American. That in turn could give Chinese companies a chance to be in the AI race.Quantum, robotics and driverless is the futureHuang often uses public appearances to talk about the future.I asked him about some of those areas he's bullish on like robotics and driverless cars, technology that Nvidia's products can power.Huang told me this will be the \"decade of\" autonomous vehicles and robotics.Nvidia boss Jensen Huang delivers a speech on stage talking about robotics.Arjun Kharpal | CNBCDuring his keynote at GTC Paris on Wednesday, he also address quantum computing, saying the technology is reaching \"an inflection point.\"Quantum computers are widely believed to be able to solve complex problems that classic computers can't. This could include things like discovering new drugs or materials.", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "3bshqnf9hy8jfmy", "date": "2025-06-14 06:05:19.000Z"}}

I tested both out\nContent: Here's my first dilemma of the day: the new Luckin Coffee near my office in Hong Kong wants me to download their app for a $2 drink. Without it, it's $3.75.Fine. I register, get a WhatsApp code and scroll through their menu: fruity Americanos, a seasonal kale tea and the coconut milk latte \u2014 a bestseller with five sweetness levels.The menus are something else. This coconut comes from Luckin's own grove in Indonesia, it says, blessed by volcanic ash and ocean nutrients. The milk is cold-pressed within four hours of cracking the fruit open. Sure, Luckin. I click iced, no added sugar.Luckin's kiosks take orders if you're not using its app.Elaine Yu | CNBCLuckin, China's largest coffee chain, is betting its kaleidoscopic offerings and clever pricing can take on Starbucks globally. The chain landed in Hong Kong late last year and now has a dozen stores across the city.\u00a0This branch alone has seven other coffee shops nearby, including Cotti Coffee, a rival founded by former Luckin executives (who were ousted over an accounting scandal that got Luckin delisted from Nasdaq. But that's another story). Cotti just opened stores in New York, and Luckin is set to follow.I try paying with credit card instead of Chinese e-payment options, but that means entering my billing details and address in-app. Too much work. I bail and use the kiosk instead at the higher price. Still need to input my phone number though.My 16-ounce drink promptly arrives. Chestnut brown in color, my first sip is bitter and refreshing. One stir with the paper straw and it turns pale blonde, the coconut's silky, nutty sweetness taking over. After a few more compulsive sips, it gets heavy.Luckin says the coconut used in my $3.75 latte is sourced from the company's own grove in Indonesia.Elaine Yu | CNBCMatcha latte with tofu puddingMainstream coffee culture is converging globally, and Luckin is making it more digital, efficient \u2014 and gimmicky. Their basics \u2014 black coffee, oat milk latte \u2014 hook customers looking for a cheap caffeine fix (they cost roughly $2 each in Asia). Here, Starbucks has no real edge. \"It comes down to value for money,\" an Australian buying a mocha from Luckin tells me.Office workers stream through, grabbing drinks pre-ordered on the app. Few linger. Andy Chan, 38, emerges from the nearby subway station and picks up his usual Americano en route to the office. \"It's normal,\" the IT worker says of the quality. \"And quite a bit cheaper than Starbucks.\"Hours later, I walk to the Starbucks down the block. Patrons are on their laptops or deep in conversation. Similar to Luckin, the drink offerings rotate through supposedly regional flavors, like matcha latte with tofu pudding. This branch just went cashless, notable in cash-stubborn Hong Kong.Starbucks, which is lowering the prices of dozens of drinks in mainland China as competition intensifies, launches seasonal ice drinks for the summer.Elaine Yu | CNBCI order a yuzu cold brew, which is more like citrus slushy dunked in coffee. Nearly $6 for 12 ounces feels steep after Luckin, but the sign says the cold brews are steeped for 20 hours. I ask for a glass after the barista automatically reaches for a paper cup. The flavors click into focus once the sweet, herbal ice crystals soak up the coffee. As someone who usually drinks black coffee or a flat white at most, my two caffeinated desserts today have me wired.Coffeehouse theater vs. convenienceBusinesses say they reward loyalty. Starbucks' take is getting you to lend them money while locking you in. The Seattle-based chain sits on $1.85 billion from its stored-value cards and loyalty programs as of the first quarter this year. A portion typically goes unredeemed \u2014 turning into revenue. Sales have been declining, but Starbucks has tapped interest-free capital this way for years.Starbucks' classic fare, along with regionally inspired items like matcha mochi muffins.Elaine Yu | CNBCIf Starbucks is acting like a bank, Luckin is like the startup gunning for scale. With coffee prices rising, chains like Luckin are grabbing market share through high turnover and compact spaces that drive down costs. Some people want the coffeehouse theater; others prize convenience and live digitally. Out of the latter, Luckin is building a treasure trove of data.\u00a0Viral stunts like its Moutai liquor-infused latte help (I wouldn't try their kale tea, but this I would). Luckin launched nearly 120 items in 2024 alone, likely keeping Starbucks' Asian R&D teams up at night.Coffee is splintering into different worlds. You can get a pricey pour-over with wine-like tasting notes, an espresso at a historical cafe, a cortado at a boutique spot, or a boba-like latte at one of Luckin's 20,000+ \u00a0outlets. Luckin may be turbocharging coffee fads with its dizzying flavor rollouts, but its core market of price-sensitive consumers aren't going anywhere.The future has room for different models \u2014 there are enough caffeine addicts and social drinkers to sustain various empires. But there's no denying the pressure is on incumbents like Starbucks to refresh their identity before third space becomes third choice.", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "v6watl4k3p1mt2y", "date": "2025-06-14 06:03:40.000Z"}}

Members of the Dawn Project, Tesla Takedown and Resist Austin say that Tesla's partially automated driving systems have safety problems.Tesla sells its cars with a standard Autopilot package, or a premium Full Self-Driving option (also known as FSD or FSD supervised), in the U.S. Automobiles with these systems, which include features like automatic lane keeping, steering and parking, have been involved in hundreds of collisions, including dozens of fatalities, according to data tracked by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Tesla's robotaxis, which Musk showed off in a video clip on X earlier this week, are new versions of the company's popular Model Y vehicles, equipped with a future release of Tesla's FSD software. That \"unsupervised\" FSD, or robotaxi technology, is not yet available to the public.Tesla critics with The Dawn Project, which calls itself a tech-safety and security education business, brought a version of Model Y with relatively recent FSD software (version 13.2.9) to show residents of Austin how it works.In their demonstration on Thursday, they showed how a Tesla with FSD engaged zoomed past a school bus with a stop sign held out and ran over a child-sized mannequin that they put in front of the vehicle.A Tesla Model Y with Full Self-Driving (Supervised) v. 13.2.9 engaged fails to stop for a child dummy in the road at a demonstration in Austin, Texas on June 12, 2025.Todd WisemanDawn Project CEO Dan O'Dowd also runs Green Hills Software, which sells technology to Tesla competitors,\u00a0including Ford and Toyota.Stephanie Gomez, who attended the demonstration, told CNBC that she didn't like the role Musk had been playing in the government. Additionally, she said she has no confidence in Tesla's safety standards and said there's been a lack of transparency from the company regarding how its robotaxis will work.Another protester, Silvia Revelis, said she also opposed Musk's political activity, but that safety is the biggest concern.\"Citizens have not been able to get safety testing results,\" she said. \"Musk believes he's above the law.\"Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\u2014 Todd Wiseman contributed to this report.WATCH: Tesla's next leg up is $400watch now", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "v751jmn6oz59r07", "date": "2025-06-13 23:58:57.000Z"}}

Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order on Friday approving U.S. Steel's merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, after the companies signed a national security agreement with the U.S. government.U.S. Steel and Nippon said the national security agreement will give the U.S. government a \"golden share\" and makes certain commitments related to governance, domestic production, and trade. The companies did not elaborate on what powers the U.S. government will wield with its golden share.\"All necessary regulatory approvals for the partnership have now been received, and the partnership is expected to be finalized promptly,\" U.S. Steel and Nippon said in a statement.The national security agreement calls for Nippon to make $11 billion in new investments by 2028, including initial spending on a greenfield project that will be completed after 2028, the companies said.Trump said Thursday that the golden share gives the president \"total control\" without elaborating. Pennsylvania Sen. Dave McCormick told CNBC last month that the golden share will effectively allow the government to control a number of board seats.Trump opposed U.S. Steel's controversial sale to Nippon in the runup to the 2024 president election, as Republicans and Democrats have leaned into protecting U.S. companies against foreign competitors.But Trump started softening his opposition to the takeover after assuming office, ordering a new review of the deal in April. President Joe Biden had blocked U.S. Steel's sale to Nippon during his final days in office, citing national security concerns, despite Japan being a close ally.Trump has avoided calling the deal an acquisition or merger, describing it as a \"partnership\" in a May 23 post on his social media platform Truth Social. He insisted that U.S. Steel will remain \"controlled by the USA\" during a speech to workers at one of the company's plants outside Pittsburgh on May 30.U.S. Steel made clear it would become a \"wholly owned subsidiary\" of Nippon North America under the terms of the merger agreement in an April 8 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trump's description of the deal as a \"partnership\" caused confusion among investors and union leadership.The president told U.S. Steel workers that Nippon will be a \"great partner.\" The Trump administration is currently engaged in trade talks with Japan as investors eagerly await signs that the U.S. will strike deals with key partners that avoid steep tariffs.Trump told the steelworkers that Nippon had agreed to keep U.S. Steel's blast furnaces operating at full capacity for a minimum of 10 years. The president said the deal would not result in layoffs and promised there would be \"no outsourcing whatsoever.\" He said workers will receive a $5,000 bonus.Trump announced that he was doubling U.S. tariffs on steel imports to 50% during his remarks to U.S. Steel workers.

Here's how the missile defense system works\nContent: A projectile hit buildings as Israeli Iron Dome air defense system fires to intercept missiles over Tel Aviv, Israel, Friday, June 13, 2025.Leo Correa | AP PhotoThe Iron Dome missile defense system, or \"Kippat Barzel\" in Hebrew, is widely regarded as one of the most important tools in Israel's defensive arsenal.Designed to protect Israeli citizens from aerial attacks by launching guided missiles to intercept incoming rockets and other short-range threats, the mobile all-weather defense system has been  fully operational since March 2011. Israel's Defense Ministry\u00a0says the system has been upgraded several times and \"successfully prevented countless rockets from hitting Israeli communities.\"The Iron Dome was developed in Israel by state-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with U.S. backing \u2014 and Washington\u00a0continues to provide funding\u00a0for it.Israel's Defense Forces\u00a0say\u00a0the Iron Dome is a compilation of several features: the technology itself, the machinery used to intercept incoming rockets, the soldiers who operate the system and the commanders who supervise the network.How does it work?In practice, the Iron Dome uses radar to track incoming rockets and determines whether the missile's trajectory threatens a protected area, such as a strategically important site or population center.If the rocket does pose a threat, a command and control center responds by launching its own Tamir missile to intercept it. The system is not configured to fire outside of a protected area, however, and rockets that don't endanger people or buildings are typically ignored and permitted to land.An explosion caused by a projectile strike illuminates the skyline in Tel Aviv, Israel, early Saturday, June 14, 2025.Leo Correa | APA 2023 Congressional Research Service\u00a0report\u00a0described the Iron Dome as a mobile anti-rocket, anti-mortar and anti-artillery system that can intercept launches from 2.5 to 43 miles away.It is estimated to have at least 10 batteries deployed nationwide, each of which is designed to defend a 60-square-mile populated area. Each battery is equipped with three to four launchers and each launcher contains up to 20 Tamir interceptors.The Center for Strategic International Studies, a U.S. think tank, has\u00a0estimated\u00a0that a single Iron Dome battery costs more than $100 million to produce.Since 2011, the United States has\u00a0provided billions of dollars to Israel for Iron Dome batteries, interceptors, co-production costs and general maintenance since it became operational.Much of this money has been appropriated by Congress, where bipartisan majorities have\u00a0consistently voted\u00a0in favor of providing funding to Israel's Iron Dome.The Iron Dome has its weaknesses, however. Analysts have warned that the defense system could encounter challenges when responding to heavy rocket fire.The Center for European Policy Analysis, a U.S. think tank,\u00a0said in June 2021\u00a0that the system was potentially vulnerable to a \"saturation\" attack, designed to overwhelm the Iron Dome shield with simultaneous missile attacks from multiple directions.

It offers free credit card debt relief consultations.Pros$7,500 debt requirement is lower than many competitorsCustomer service available seven days a weekA+ Better Business Bureau ratingConsNot available in all statesKnow what kind of debt relief you needTo choose the best debt settlement company for your needs, you must first know what support you need. Debt relief comes in a variety of forms, and different companies might offer help with different types of relief.A debt settlement company will most likely be focused on one or all of these types of relief:Forgiveness: It will negotiate with a creditor or debt collector to settle your debt for a reduced lump-sum payment and forgive the rest.Payment plan: It will help you set up a payment plan with the creditor or debt collector to pay off your debt over time, based on what you can afford to pay each month.Validation: It will request proof from the creditor or debt collector of the money you owe. A company can't collect debt it can't validate.However, there are other relief options that could also be a fit for you \u2014 or even a better choice than debt settlement. Consider whether you want to pursue these options that debt settlement companies don't typically offer:Consolidation: You can take out a debt consolidation loan to roll multiple outstanding debts into a single monthly payment. This might reduce your overall interest or get you a smaller monthly payment (or both), making the debt less of a burden to repay. For this service, you'll need to work with a debt consolidation company or lender. You may need to meet certain credit requirements to qualify.Bankruptcy: If debt repayment is causing you financial hardship, you may be able to file to discharge eligible debts in bankruptcy. For this option, you can file yourself, but you would probably be better off working with a bankruptcy lawyer.None of these forms of debt relief are guaranteed, regardless of the type of company you work with. You should do your research before you make a plan. Schedule a free consultation call with a debt settlement company and/or a bankruptcy lawyer. You can get pre-qualified consolidation loan offers before applying. By doing this research, you can get a clear picture of what's best for your situation before you commit to any plan.What to look for in a debt settlement companyAs you research debt settlement companies \u2014 and vet them through a consultation call \u2014 look into these details to ensure the company is offering a reliable service.AccreditationThe company should be accredited by the nonprofit International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators (IAPDA) and/or the industry group American Association for Debt Resolution (AADR). This accreditation shows the company is maintaining accountability standards for debt relief.Comprehensive debt-relief optionsThe company and its representatives should be honest about what it can and can't do for you. No one can guarantee you debt relief, and a debt settlement consultation should include a review of all your debt-relief options, including those the company doesn't offer, to determine what's best for your situation.Transparency and pre-approvalYou need full transparency into the status of your debts. You should receive reports from the company or have access to a dashboard where you can see how much you've saved toward debt relief and which settlements the company have successfully negotiated for you.You should get pre-approval before the company agrees to any settlements or payment plans on your behalf.Fair feesDebt relief fees are typically between 15% and 25% of the debt balance you start with. Fees should only be charged after the company negotiates a settlement for you, never up front.Red flags to look out forA lot of legitimate and reliable debt settlement companies exist, but the industry is also rife with scammers preying on debtors desperate for relief. Look out for these red flags that might signal a company isn't legitimate, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau:Upfront feesA debt-relief company shouldn't charge you anything before it's provided a service. Fees come as a percentage of settled debts and should be charged only after you've received a settlement.Lofty promisesSome companies try to hook you by promising to save you a specific percentage or amount of money in debt forgiveness. It can't make this guarantee before negotiating with your creditors, though.It also can't guarantee it will eliminate your debts, stop debt collection calls or end lawsuits.Claims to work with a government programThere are no government programs that help with consumer debt relief, so don't believe a company that says its working with one (even if it claims it's \"new\").Note that legitimate programs do exist for government-back loans, like FHA mortgages and student loans, but you should work directly with your loan servicer to access them, not a third party.Instructions to stop contacting or paying your creditorsYou'll likely still owe minimum payments to creditors while you're in a debt-relief program.A debt settlement company shouldn't tell you to cut off contact with creditors and debt collectors; you have every right to continue communicating with them on your own, in addition to any negotiations the company is leading.Fast debt relief claimsIt commonly takes anywhere from 18 to 48 months to negotiate and pay off debts via a debt relief company. Beware of companies promising relief in just a few weeks or months.Plans to eliminate all negative marks on your credit reportYou can't get rid of negative marks on your credit report as long as they're accurate.Debt-relief companies can request validation and help you clear unvalidated lines from your credit report. But if debts can be validated (and most can), they'll remain on your credit report until they're forgiven or repaid.Tackle your debtFinding the right debt-relief plan can be a game changer. The process is lengthy and requires patience, but you can significantly change your financial situation with the right company on your side.Not sure where to start?

The last time Oracle had a better week was in April 2001, in the middle of the dot-com crash, when so-called dead-cat bounces were common. During the prior quarter, Oracle shares lost almost half their value.It's a much different company today, and while Oracle was generally viewed as a late entrant into the cloud infrastructure market, the company has found a niche and is seeing rapid growth helping clients operate artificial intelligence models.\"Oracle is in the enviable position of having more demand than it can fulfill,\" Joseph Bonner, an analyst at Argus Research, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. He recommends buying the shares and lifted his price target to $235 from $200.Oracle rose to a record on Friday, closing at $215.22.In the company's earnings report late Wednesday, revenue and earnings topped estimates. CEO Safra Catz said sales for the new fiscal year should come in above $67 billion, higher than LSEG's $65.18 billion consensus.\"The demand is astronomical,\" Larry Ellison, Oracle's chairman told analysts on the earnings call. \"But we have to do this methodically. The reason demand continues to outstrip supply is we can only build these data centers, build these computers, so fast.\"Oracle has been playing catch-up in cloud to rivals Amazon, Google and Microsoft.In the 2025 fiscal year, Oracle's capital expenditures exceeded $21 billion, which is more than the company spent from 2019 to 2024. The sum should reach $25 billion in fiscal 2026, Catz said on the call.Google anticipates $75 billion in capital spending this year. Microsoft's target for the fiscal year is $80 billion.Oracle's client list now includes Meta, OpenAI and Elon Musk's xAI.

They cite reasons like economic uncertainty given potential tariffs and layoffs. Mentions of layoffs on the site surged 9%.May job cuts by U.S.-based employers were up 47% from the same month the year before, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Employers cut 93,816 jobs in May 2025 versus 63,816 in May 2024. The U.S. also added 139,000 jobs\u00a0in May, slightly lower than April's 147,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Entry-level employees are the least optimistic of any age group. Their confidence level hit a record low since 2016 in May, 43.4%. Here's why young workers have such a negative outlook on the job market right now.'It's hard for young grads to get onto the career ladder'For jobseekers just beginning their careers, opportunities are hard to come by.Katherine Diep, 21, just graduated from the University of California Irvine with a bachelor's in business economics. She's looking for work in events marketing and started applying for jobs at the beginning of the school year.\"I applied to over 200 to 300 jobs,\" she says, \"and have not landed any so far, unfortunately.\"Uncertainty in the economy means employers are hesitant to open up new roles. And \"the low hiring environment we're in right now means it's hard for young grads to get onto the career ladder in the first place,\" says lead economist at Glassdoor Daniel Zhao.'Employees have less leverage to climb'For those entry-level workers who've been able to secure work, their upward trajectory is unclear.\"Because employers are not hiring as much,\" says Zhao, \"employees have less leverage to climb the career ladder internally, as well as fewer opportunities to find those promotions or raises by switching jobs.\"And they're facing more competition. \"Layoffs of experienced workers and managers means that there's more bunching at the bottom of the career ladder\" and more people vying for the same roles internally, he says.Growth and career opportunities are especially key \"for younger workers who are just starting out and trying to navigate their career paths,\" says Zhao. Not having many concrete opportunities to map out where they could go weighs on their confidence levels.'Once a month or so I'll break down'Even as they face uncertainty and rejection, some entry-level workers are keeping a positive outlook.Ngina Valdez, 22, graduated from Syracuse University in May where she studied communications and computer science. Like Diep, she started applying for jobs in the fall.\"I've applied to probably 100 journalism jobs, or jobs within communications,\" plus around 60 jobs in computer science, she says.\"Once a month or so I'll break down, just because I haven't gotten anything,\" she says. Still, she adds, \"the 29 other days in the month, I am really motivated.\" She's pivoting when she needs to and tweaking her application material to make it better.\"I just updated my website, and that made me really excited to apply to more jobs.\"Are you ready to buy a house?\u00a0Take Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course\u00a0How to Buy Your First Home.

{"instruction": "Does the article content match the title?", "input": "Title: Pinnacle Blooms Network Global Autism Framework to Empower 90 Cr Kids & Families\nContent: In a historic breakthrough that is transforming the world's perception of autism therapy, India has developed a universally accessible, AI-powered autism therapy model currently being researched and implemented on all continents. Led by Pinnacle Blooms Network, an innovation born out of empathy that is women-driven, this model provides hope and change to millions of children and families who have spent years living in silence and doubt.&nbsp;In India, autism and developmental delays have been underappreciated and misdiagnosed for decades as behavioral problems or poor parenting. Now, more than 90% of kids with neurodevelopmental disorders are still undiagnosed or untreated until there is irreversible developmental delay. With an estimated one in every 68 children having an autism spectrum disorder and one in every five with early signs of speech or communication delays, the sheer need for an integral, culturally appropriate, and scalable therapy model was imperative.&nbsp;&nbsp;  A Silent Revolution Starts&nbsp;It began with a mother's determination. Dr. Sreeja Reddy Saripalli, fueled by experience and a dream to redefine the story of children with autism, designed what was never there before\u2014a therapy environment that revolves around the child, the family, and the community. In 2014, Pinnacle Blooms Network launched its first center, not only to offer therapy, but to create an integrated network of support.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the years, Pinnacle has launched groundbreaking innovations:&nbsp;&nbsp;TherapySphere\u00ae, a safe, sensory-safe therapy space,&nbsp;AbilityScore\u00ae, a patented developmental scoring system providing clarity to otherwise indeterminate diagnostic hurdles,&nbsp;TherapeuticAI\u00ae, an artificial intelligence engine that forecasts behavioral meltdowns and assists real-time therapy planning,&nbsp;SEVA\u2122, a dignity-first model offering free therapy to underserved populations including families with incomes less than \u20b925,000 per month,&nbsp;PinnacleNationalHeroes\u00ae, offering lifetime free therapy to families of India's defense and civic service members.&nbsp; Presently, Pinnacle has more than 70 centers across the country, sustained by 1,600 trained professionals and having served over 19 million sessions of therapy with a 97% recorded rate of improvement. It is not merely a health service \u2014 it is a movement sustained by women empowerment, maternal leadership, and inclusive design.&nbsp;  Breaking the Silence: Stories of Hope&nbsp;In rural Telangana, four-year-old Anjali\u2019s breakthrough moment captured the essence of Pinnacle\u2019s impact. After weeks of silent struggle with communication, a simple flashcard delivered through a specially designed therapy program allowed Anjali to connect visually and emotionally with her mother for the first time. Moments like these are quietly unfolding every day across India\u2019s diverse geographies, from tribal regions to urban centers.&nbsp; A Model Made for India, Tailored for the World&nbsp;As opposed to other imported Western-style conventional models of therapy, Pinnacle Blooms was established from scratch for India's extensive linguistic, cultural, and economic heterogeneity. It functions across over 133 languages and dialects, treading carefully to respect the individual culture rhythm and family background of each child. This flexibility has enabled it not only to succeed in urban cities but also in India's second- and third-tier towns, bringing therapy to those beyond the urban elite.&nbsp;Its cloud-based, modular architecture takes advantage of shared communications tools such as WhatsApp and SMS, as opposed to high-bandwidth applications, which makes the system robust and scalable even in low-resource environments.&nbsp;The AI aspects of the system don't supplant human intuition but augment it\u2014giving therapists predictive information and allowing them to deliver targeted interventions that are attuned to each child's environment and behavior.&nbsp;  Global Recognition and Adoption&nbsp;Pinnacle Blooms Network\u2019s pioneering work has garnered national honors, including recognition from the Telangana government and leading Indian media outlets. It has been celebrated for its women-led workforce, trauma-informed care culture, and public-private hybrid model that balances innovation with dignity and inclusiveness.&nbsp; Internationally, the framework is attracting significant attention:&nbsp;Academic collaborations are underway with institutions such as Stanford University, Heidelberg University, and Singapore Institute of Mental Health.&nbsp;Nepal, UAE, Kenya, and Bangladesh governments and ministries are considering licensing AbilityScore\u00ae.&nbsp;UNICEF and WHO-SEARO are investigating Pinnacle's SEVA\u2122 model and TherapeuticAI\u00ae for rural and tech-enabled early intervention programs.&nbsp;It is included in UN development drafts on childhood digital health and AI policy whitepapers that emphasize empathy-based technologies.&nbsp;Nations throughout Africa, Southeast Asia, and the UK are testing Pinnacle's model to tackle their specific challenges for autism therapy. Kenya, for instance, has an acute need for trained child therapists and thus sees the low-cost, scalable Pinnacle strategy as essential. Boroughs in the UK with large South Asian populations are also studying its cultural and linguistic flexibility.&nbsp;  Why Pinnacle's Model Works&nbsp; Pinnacle's success is the synergy of science, compassion, and context-aware technology. It substitutes the normally inaccessible and disjointed services with an integrated system that scores, monitors, and redesigns developmental advancement. Therapy is no longer a luxury for the select few\u2014it is now an everyday habit, integrated in homes, schools, and communities.&nbsp;The model's architecture respects diversity and inclusion by default. It doesn't divide children by income or background; a diplomat's child and a farmer's child are treated side by side, with equality and dignity.&nbsp;  Pinnacle's fundamental elements illustrate world relevance:&nbsp;The AbilityScore\u00ae system translates development skills in a borderless way.&nbsp;The TherapeuticAI engine learns from unique behaviors, not stationary positions.&nbsp;The TherapySphere\u2122 space heals via sensory design across language differences.&nbsp;The Everyday Therapy\u2122 systems empower caregivers and families as full partners.&nbsp;The cultural calibration of the framework prevents children from having to fit into a certain mold; instead, the system adapts to them.&nbsp;  A Call for Global Partnership&nbsp;Pinnacle Blooms Network now invites governments, health ministries, NGOs, AI researchers, teachers, and parent communities across the globe to contribute to co-creating a common global developmental blueprint. Its vision is bold but inclusive: to empower 90 crore (900 million) children and families with a transparent, scalable, and flexible therapy ecosystem.&nbsp;Collaborative opportunities are:&nbsp;Creating country-specific developmental indices.&nbsp;Training local dialect AI models.&nbsp;Donating and scaling SEVA\u2122 programs in resource-constrained regions.&nbsp;Incorporating Everyday Therapy\u2122 into national education curricula.&nbsp;Establishing an open-source, mother-powered global therapy intelligence network.&nbsp;Already, pilot initiatives are being implemented in the UAE, UK, USA, Africa, and the Maldives, proving the framework's readiness for global action.&nbsp;  Conclusion&nbsp;India's Pinnacle Blooms Network hasn't simply established a therapy company or produced a campaign\u2014its founders have written a new world playbook for the treatment of autism. Constructed by mothers, guided by women, and fueled by innovative technology imbued with compassion, this blueprint is shining a light of promise to the millions of youngsters the world has forgotten.&nbsp;This is a tale of invention without compromise, of exceptionless inclusion, and of therapy founded not upon charity but conviction.\u202f&nbsp;With the world looking on and taking note, Pinnacle's story represents a watershed moment\u2014one in which solutions are not created top-down but arise from lived experience, cultural knowledge, and an unwavering faith in the ability of every child.&nbsp;(At The Quint, we question everything.

{"instruction": "Does the article content match the title?", "input": "Title: Meghalaya Murder is What Happens When You Criminalise Love in India\nContent: Indian parents must take responsibility. Sonam Raghuvanshi told her parents about Raj, the man she was in love with, and they responded in classic Indian parent style - they forced her to marry someone else.Raj was their employee and it\u2019s likely they took issue with his caste/economic status/skin colour/profession or any of the other allergens that react badly with Indian parents\u2019 disregard for their adult children\u2019s hopes and dreams. As someone who co-founded a space where interfaith, intercaste, and LGBTQIA+ couples can share their stories and support each other, I can tell you this country doesn\u2019t believe that young people have the right to choose their partners. In fact, we have even criminalised some choices. From the profession they pick, to the way they dress, to what they eat and to who they love, adult children have no freedom to live their own lives. Parents are the Indian lover\u2019s biggest, seemingly insurmountable obstacle. Sonam\u2019s folks insisted/demanded she marry someone else. According to one report that quotes an anonymous source, Sonam told her parents: \u201cYou will see what I do to that person. You all will have to bear the consequences.\u201dHow many times have we heard Indian parents threaten their children with exactly the same sentence? A woman once told me she had to leave her interfaith lover of 10 years because her father wouldn\u2019t budge and she couldn\u2019t bear to break his heart.\u201cNa main karwaunga, na main hone dunga. (Nor will I agree to the match, nor will I let it happen),\u201d he told her. Many parents act on these threats. We even have a word for the crime: \u2018honour\u2019 killing.Now, some Indian women\u2014pushed to the wall in a digital age of infinite possibilities, yet expected to marry whomever their parents choose like generations before them\u2014are responding in the most extreme of ways, like Sonam did. I\u2019m calling it the anti-honour killing. Violent backlash by women is not surprising in a society that condones violence against them from the time they are born (or even before that).Shillong Honeymoon Case: A Tale of Love, Patriarchy, and Murder\u00a0Chennai-based Kathir, who runs Evidence, an organisation that tracks the heinous crime of honour killings (or rather dishonour killings) once shared with me the story of Sripriya, from the Kallar community, who married Bhadrakali, a Dalit. They were engineers who fell in love and decided to go against the wishes of their family. One day, her father showed up at their place bearing gifts, quite like in the 2016 Marathi film Sairat. You know how that visit ended. He tried to convince Sripriya to return home and, when she refused, his companions hacked her to death. \u201cWhen I visited Sripriya\u2019s home the next day, the fruits and sweets were still there,\u201d Kathir said. When he asked the father, who was by then in jail, if his caste was more important than his daughter, the man replied: \u201cIt is more important than God\u201d.The anti honour-killing was waiting to happen. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s getting publicity\u2014even if the discourse is mostly misogynistic\u2014because it is an important cautionary tale for a society that values obedience over free choice and independent thinking. In fact, according to the news archives, there have been a few similar cases in recent months.In Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Auraiya, Pragati Yadav hired a contract killer to murder her husband Dilip Yadav two weeks after they married. She told the police she had been made to marry him against her will. In Gujarat, Payal Dantani was in love with her cousin Kalpesh. Her parents forced her to marry a man called Bhavik. It\u2019s likely that the trapped 23-year-old woman felt the fastest way out of this situation would be to kill her new husband. Bhavik was murdered three days after they married.As a society, we struggle to teach our boys about consent. The idea of asking a woman if she is okay with marrying him will likely not even occur to most men who have arranged marriages. According to one report, Bhavik told his father that he suspected his wife was dissatisfied with the marriage. Communicating openly with partners is still not seen as a basic requirement of a fulfilling relationship in this country.After Sonam Raghuvanshi murdered her husband, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav said the crime should make people think \u201cif children should be allowed to go so far.\u201dI\u2019ve put a lot of the onus on parents in this piece, but Yadav\u2019s comment is a classic illustration of the dark thought bubble looming over parents\u2019 heads when their child says they are in love with someone: Log kya kahenge? What will people say? The fear of social boycott is a big driver of parental response.Our society is okay with lovers being murdered for marrying someone from a different caste or religion. So why are we shocked when women like Sonam, Pragati, and Payal feel desperate enough to return the favour? We no longer live in the world of Ek Duje Ke Liye, where the lovers saw no alternative but to leap off the cliff and kill themselves. Women are not interested in doing a Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, where they are forced to leave their lover and learn to love the man they were pressured to marry.Some lovers fight long drawn battles with their parents, evolving strategies to win over their parents that may take years. Some cut off ties. Some pick Satyashodhak ceremonies where the constitution and vows replace religious rituals. And some? They choose what they see as an \u2018easier\u2019 route. They emulate the violent responses of their parents.(The author is the founder of India Love Project and on the editorial board of Article 14. This is an opinion piece.

{"instruction": "Does the article content match the title?", "input": "Title: Air India Crash: Kerala Nurse Planned To Return From UK, Take Care of Mom, Kids\nContent: \"She was the brightest among all the children in our family,\" said Kerala resident Unnikrishnan Panthaplavil, the maternal uncle of Ranjitha Gopakumaran, who was among those killed in the horrific Air India crash in Ahmedabad on Thursday, 12 June.Hailing from Kerala's Pathanamthitta district, the 42-year-old worked as a nurse in the UK and was going there to resume her job after a three-day trip to her village, Pullad. She had come to review the construction of the family's new home and sign some papers. While boarding the train to Kochi on Wednesday, 11 June, she had assured her mother Thulasi that she would come back next month for the housewarming ceremony.\"It's so unfortunate... her untimely death came at a time when she was finally emerging with flying colours after a long period of struggle,\" Panthaplavil told The Quint.Condolences Pour In for Two Pilots, Crew Members of Crashed Air India FlightJohnson Thomas, Ranjitha's neighbour and the head of the Koyippuram village panchayat, said that she had been planning to return from the UK for good and take up a job at the District Government Hospital in Pathanamthitta.She wanted to be closer to home so that she could take care of her elderly mother, and her two children, Induchoodan and Rithika, who are studying in classes 7 and 10, respectively. Her father, Gopinathan Nair, passed away around 10 years ago.\"I've known Ranjitha since she was a child.

The family returned to India after Ranjitha got a job as a nurse at a government hospital in Kerala. However, her marriage with Vineesh eventually fell apart, after which she moved to the UK to continue working as a nurse.\"Her children and mother still don't know about her death... we don't know how to break the news to them,\" her uncle Panthaplavil says.\"Rithika and Induchoodan have been asking me and other relatives to call their mother and ask whether she landed in the UK safely.

What Will Probe Focus on?\nContent: An Air India plane bound for London Gatwick airport crashed shortly after take-off on 12 January in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. Flight AI171 was carrying 242 people, including 169 Indian nationals, 53 British nationals, seven Portuguese, and one Canadian. Professor Ali Elham, from the University of Southampton\u2019s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, answers all the pressing questions about the plane involved in the crash\u2014Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner\u2014which has come under scanner post the disaster. What is the Dreamliner\u2019s safety record like? What will the crash investigation focus on? Read on for more.Condolences Pour In for Two Pilots, Crew Members of Crashed Air India FlightThe Dreamliner was a huge breakthrough in aircraft design. For example, it was the first Boeing aircraft with more than 50 percent composite material in its structure. In this case, composite material refers mainly to carbon fibre. This carbon fibre was replacing parts of the structure that would have been made from aluminium in previous types of aircraft. This contributed to a huge reduction in aircraft weight.There were many innovations in the 787, making it very different from previous iterations of Boeing aircraft, such as the 747 and 767.The combination of new engines, improved aerodynamics, and significant weight reduction\u2014largely due to the use of composite materials\u2014resulted in notable reductions in both fuel consumption and carbon emissions compared to previous-generation aircraft. Another feature was the greatly increased electrification of the plane, with more use of batteries for onboard power systems.The Dreamliner has a very good safety record and has been flying for many years without significant problems. But when the plane was new, in 2013 or so, there were a few incidents in which the aircraft\u2019s lithium-ion batteries overheated, in some cases resulting in smoke or even catching fire, both on the ground and during flight. There were no casualties and the aircraft were all able to land safely. But Boeing grounded all Dreamliners for a few months.Boeing intensively investigated the problem. They redesigned the batteries, they redesigned the battery containers and then they ran tests and an extensive certification process that allowed them to return the Dreamliners to flight. Since then, there have been no incidents with batteries as far as I am aware.Batteries were used instead of getting power from the gas turbines in the engines. The power is used for instruments, for electronics and many other aircraft systems. Increased electrification \u2013 getting more of the aircraft\u2019s power from batteries \u2013 contributes to reducing carbon emissions, because the gas turbines run on kerosene.'Bodies Everywhere': One Passenger Miraculously Survives Air India Plane CrashIt\u2019s too early to say anything about the cause of the crash, and as far as I\u2019m aware no official details have been released about the cause.Generally speaking, however, when you investigate air crashes, they often involve a chain of problems. One thing happens, then a number of events follow from that. So it might not be one cause here.This crash occurred shortly after take-off. While flying is statistically the safest form of transport, the takeoff and landing phases are generally considered the most critical. This is because aircraft operate closer to the ground, with less time and altitude to respond to technical issues or sudden changes. Although not inherently dangerous, these phases carry a higher risk of incidents compared to cruising at altitude.Air India Plane Crash: Airline Confirms 241 Fatalities, 1 Passenger SurvivesThey will investigate everything. They will search for the data recorders (black boxes), which are designed to survive a crash. If these are recovered, investigators will be able to view all the flight data, hear all the cockpit conversations. They will take all the information from the control tower. Sometimes clues can be found from all this data. They will also examine the wreckage of the aircraft in detail.It\u2019s a different situation from the Boeing 737 Max groundings, which followed two crashes linked to a specific and repeatable software flaw. Similarly, when the Dreamliner first entered service, a series of battery overheating incidents revealed a systemic issue that led regulators to temporarily ground the fleet.In the current case, unless investigators identify a recurring technical problem that poses an immediate risk to other 787s, a fleet-wide grounding would be unlikely. Safety is always the top priority, but regulatory responses typically depend on whether an issue appears to be isolated or part of a broader pattern.It must be said that the 787 Dreamliner has a very good safety record. It had a very long certification period with the Federal Aviation Administration in the US.(In this piece, Professor Ali Elham from the University of Southampton\u2019s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, speaks to The Conversation\u2019s Paul Rincon.

The vessel had departed from Vizhinjam Port on 23 May and was en route to Kochi, with an estimated time of arrival on 25 May. However, it sank on 25 May. All 24 crew members were successfully rescued by the Indian Coast Guard.&nbsp;MSC ELSA 3 was carrying 640 containers, including 13 containing hazardous materials and 12 with calcium carbide. The ship also had 84.44 metric tonnes of diesel and 367.1 metric tonnes of furnace oil in its tanks.&nbsp;In response to the incident, the Indian Coast Guard activated a comprehensive pollution response protocol and is working closely with the state administration to address all potential environmental threats.&nbsp;Hazardous Cargo Spill Off Kerala Coast: Experts Warn of 'Lasting' Marine DamageFollowing the sinking off the Alappuzha coast, concerns were raised about a possible oil spill. The Indian Coast Guard responded swiftly, deploying ICG Ship Saksham, equipped with pollution control gear. A Dornier aircraft was also deployed for aerial surveillance and to disperse oil spill dispersant (OSD) as part of the containment operation.&nbsp;In addition to the oil spill threat, several containers from the sunken MSC ELSA 3 washed ashore along the Kerala coast. According to a note from the Directorate General of Shipping dated 9 June, a total of 51 out of 61 containers that drifted ashore have been successfully recovered and returned to port. Salvage operations are ongoing to recover the remaining 10 containers.&nbsp;Just weeks after the MSC ELSA 3 incident, another maritime emergency unfolded off the Kerala coast. On 9 June, the Singapore-flagged container vessel MV WAN HAI 503, located approximately 130 nautical miles northwest of the Kerala coast, reported fires and explosions midship, extending to the container bay ahead of the accommodation block.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Indian Coast Guard's update on 10 June, the forward bay fire has been brought under control, but thick smoke continues to emerge, and the vessel is listing approximately 10\u201315 degrees to port. Several containers have also fallen overboard.&nbsp;The Indian Coast Guard has launched extensive firefighting and containment operations. ICG ships Samudra Prahari and Sachet are engaged in firefighting (Fi-Fi) operations and boundary cooling, while ICG ship Samarth, along with salvage teams, is being deployed from Kochi.&nbsp;&nbsp;For India\u2019s Maritime Coordinator, Pak & China Will Be Biggest ChallengesDespite the environmental damage caused by toxic materials and plastic nurdles from the containers of MSC ELSA 3\u2014which began polluting the sea and Kerala\u2019s coastline on 24 May\u2014and the resulting threat to the livelihood of local fishermen, the Kerala government did not file a police case against the shipping company.According to official documents that surfaced on 29 May, a high-level meeting was held under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, attended by the Director General of Shipping, Shyam Jagannathan, and the state chief secretary.During the meeting, the state reportedly decided not to immediately initiate legal action against the company responsible for the vessel.&nbsp;An official document accessed by The Quint states: \u201cMSC is a reputed company which patronises the Vizhinjam International Seaport, and the company requires the goodwill of Kerala for their operations here. It is also in their interest to cooperate with Kerala and settle the claims through the insurance agency. Considering all these aspects, our claim should be based on strong evidence and without any compromise.\u201dIn 2016, the Ministry of Home Affairs had issued a gazette notification under the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and Other Maritime Zones Act, 1976, empowering 10 coastal police stations across the east and west coasts to investigate offences committed by any person within India\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).&nbsp;These police stations include Fort Kochi Coastal Police Station (Kerala and Lakshadweep), Navibandar Coastal Police Station (Gujarat), Yellow Gate Police Station (Maharashtra and Daman &amp; Diu), Harbour Coastal Security Police Station (Goa), Mangalore Coastal Security Police Station (Karnataka), B5 Harbour Police Station (Tamil Nadu and Puducherry), Gilakaladindi Police Station in Machilipatnam (Andhra Pradesh), Paradeep Marine Police Station (Odisha), Nayachar Coastal Police Station (West Bengal), and the Central Crime Station in Port Blair (Andaman and Nicobar Islands).&nbsp;Speaking to The Quint, VJ Mathews, a senior advocate with over 42 years of experience practicing law in the Indian High Courts and the Supreme Court, as well as in arbitration and maritime law both in India and internationally, stated that without filing an FIR, neither the state government nor the union government has any standing to claim compensation.&nbsp;\u201cCiting nautical mile limitations is not a valid reason. In 2012, we filed a case against two Italian marines aboard the MV Enrica Lexie for firing at and killing two Indian fishermen off the Kerala coast. Now, in the case of MSC Elsa 3, if we are to hold the vessel\u2019s company accountable for polluting the marine environment, affecting the livelihood of fisherfolk, and endangering our lives\u2014as we are also part of the food cycle\u2014the government must first initiate penal proceedings.\"VJ MathewsMathew was the former \u202fand first Chairman of\u202f Kerala Maritime Board, and also the member of the International Maritime Transport Law Committee \u2013 IBA,\u202f responsible for Asia Pacific Region.In MV Enrica Lexie case, Kerala police had formally registered a First Information Report (FIR) against the two Italian marines on 17 February 2012, under charges including murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. The next night, on 19 February, 2012, the Kerala Police arrested Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, who were subsequently remanded to judicial custody following interrogation in Kochi.This was followed by the controversial shooting incident which occurred in 2012 approximately 20.5 nautical miles off the Kerala coast, within India\u2019s Contiguous Zone xtending from 12 to 24 nautical miles from the baseline.Although outside India\u2019s territorial waters (which end at 12 nautical miles), the area falls under Indian jurisdiction for certain legal purposes, including security and customs enforcement.&nbsp;An international tribunal under UNCLOS (2020) held the marines immune as state officials, leaving jurisdiction to Italy while India could seek compensation. In 2021, India\u2019s Supreme Court closed the criminal case after Italy paid Rs 10\u202fcrore to victims\u2019 families&nbsp;Nature Doesn\u2019t Cause Disasters, We DoAt the time of writing this story at 3 PM on Wednesday, 11 June, The Quint got hold of the copy of an FIR filed against the owner, ship master, shipping crew and others of MSC ELSA 3 on the basis of a complaint filed a C Shamji, a fisherman from Alappuzha, in Kerala.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fort Kochi Police Station have invoked Sections 282, 285, 286, 287, 288, and 3(5) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) in the case.&nbsp;Section 282 deals with rash navigation of a vessel, stipulating that anyone navigating a vessel in a rash or negligent manner that endangers human life or poses the risk of harm can face imprisonment of up to six months, a fine of up to Rs 10,000, or both. Section 285, titled \"Danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation,\" holds individuals accountable for any danger, obstruction, or injury caused\u2014through action or omission\u2014in connection with property in their possession, affecting public roads, paths, or waterways. Section 286 addresses negligent conduct involving poisonous substances, punishing those whose rash or negligent actions pose a risk to human life or who knowingly fail to take necessary safety precautions. Similarly, Section 287 deals with negligent handling of fire or combustible materials, punishable by imprisonment of up to six months, a fine of up to Rs 2,000, or both. Section 288 focuses on negligent conduct with explosive substances, outlining penalties for those whose careless use of explosives endangers lives or causes harm. Additionally, Section 3(5) of the BNS outlines the principle of joint criminal liability, holding all individuals equally responsible when a criminal act is committed by several persons in furtherance of a common intention, regardless of the specific role played by each.&nbsp;Meanwhile, speaking exclusively to The Quint, 49-year-old traditional fisherman C Shamji said the shipwreck has severely affected their livelihood.&nbsp;\u201cThe shipwreck occurred near our coast. In addition to causing environmental pollution and harming marine life, we\u2019re getting reports that fishing boats and nets are being damaged by sunken containers and debris. This is our home. Fishing is all we know. When such negligence happens, we can't remain silent. Our only resort is the Indian legal system. That\u2019s why I filed the case.\"C ShamjiConcerns were raised not only by fishermen along the Alappuzha coast, where the MSC ELSA 3 sank, but also by those in Thiruvananthapuram, Kanyakumari, and even Dhanushkodi. Containers and their contents\u2014especially plastic nurdles\u2014have been reported drifting to these shores, prompting fishermen in these areas to voice similar concerns.&nbsp;Wilson Raju, a fisherman from the Thiruvananthapuram coast, told The Quint that they were forced to halt fishing due to concerns about floating containers, debris, and plastic nurdles.&nbsp;\u201cThere was already a bad weather warning due to the early arrival of the monsoon. On top of that, the shipwreck made things worse. With no work, our families were left starving,\u201d Wilson said.&nbsp;He added that climate change has already reduced the number of viable fishing days along the coast. Rising operational costs\u2014caused by shoreline loss, fuel prices, and other logistical challenges\u2014have made fishing increasingly unviable.&nbsp;\u201cSome days, we earn around Rs 500, and on better days, maybe Rs 1,000. Nobody owns a boat anymore\u2014we have to hire them, pay rent, buy fuel. And now, on top of all that, incidents like this shipwreck are making our lives even harder.\"Wilson RajuAccording to Wilson, the number of active fishing months each year has dropped from eight to just three or four, pushing fishing communities into deep poverty. When the MSC ELSA 3 shipwreck occurred, the Kerala government announced a compensation package of \u20b91,000 and six kilograms of rice. However, Wilson said they have yet to receive it.&nbsp;Meet Kerala\u2019s Fishers Who Lost Homes to Sea Erosion, Now Living in WarehouseMeanwhile, A Biju Kumar, Vice-Chancellor of the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS), said that although the oil spill from the MSC ELSA 3 has been contained, the broken containers and their contents \u2014 such as plastic nurdles \u2014 will have a long-term impact on the coast, lasting more than 100 years.&nbsp;\u201cPlastic nurdles will eventually break down into nano-plastics. Without proper research and a thorough assessment of the pollution, we won\u2019t fully understand what lies ahead.\"A Biju KumarRegarding the WAN HAI 503 accident, the Vice-Chancellor noted that since the ship is still burning, there will be air pollution, but not much water pollution. However, he added that, according to his sources, some of the containers on board contain pesticides. \u201cAt this stage, we cannot accurately determine the extent of the impact on the marine environment,\u201d he said.&nbsp;Unfortunately, India isn\u2019t party of 1973 protocol relating to Intervention on high seas in cases of pollution by substances other than oil and has not ratified the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances (HNS Convention).&nbsp;Nikhilesh Nedumgattunmal, an assistant professor of maritime law at Dr Ambedkar Law University in Chennai, told The Quint that India\u2019s failure to ratify the 1973 Intervention Protocol and the Hazardous and Noxious Substances (HNS) Convention poses serious risks to marine ecosystems, coastal livelihoods, and the country\u2019s maritime credibility.&nbsp;He pointed out that with a 300 percent surge in Indian Ocean ship traffic between 1992 and 2012, and 9.84 billion tons of cargo moved annually, the risk of maritime accidents involving hazardous cargo is rising sharply. As climate-driven storms intensify and chemical shipping volumes increase, and with an estimated 340 million people expected to live in coastal hazard zones by 2030, the absence of key international legal safeguards puts India in a vulnerable position, both environmentally and strategically.(Rejimon Kuttappan is an idependent journalist from Kerala.

{"instruction": "Does the article content match the title?", "input": "Title: How ZOOP Quietly Fixed One Of Lending\u2019s Biggest Bottlenecks: Stamp Paper\nContent: For decades, stamp paper has quietly slowed down India\u2019s lending industry. From crowded vendor counters to sluggish state portals, the process of obtaining legally required stamp duties often delayed loan disbursements by days. Today, ZOOP, a digital workflow innovator, announces the success of its manual-to-digital eStamping platform, cutting stamp procurement time by over 90%\u2014ZOOP has cut the wait from two days to under two hours.Why stamps matter Under India\u2019s Stamp Act, certain documents are unenforceable until stamped. For lenders underwriting vehicle loans or microcredit, this means every deal stalls until paperwork is rubber-stamped\u2014literally. Even post-pandemic, many regions cling to paper-heavy processes, slowing the delivery of critical funds to entrepreneurs, small businesses, and salaried workers alike.Innovating solutions for unseen problems ZOOP\u2019s eStamping platform solves this with a third-party, legally compliant digital layer. It operates independently from government portals, yet meets all statutory requirements. Using a simple dashboard or eStamping API, NBFCs can now generate digitally signed e-stamp certificates without logging into fragmented state systems or chasing local vendors.Results that speak for themselvesSince launching in late 2024, ZOOP\u2019s platform has delivered:300,000+ e-stamps issued nationwide90% reduction in average stamping time (from 48 hours to 1.5 hours)25% improvement in loan-to-disbursement timelines\u201cWe built this solution to remove friction from one of the most overlooked parts of the lending process. By digitizing stamp procurement without compromising on legality or auditability, we\u2019re helping lenders operate faster and reach farther\u2014especially in underserved regions.\u201dRitesh Kothari, CEO of ZOOPFriction in paperwork disproportionately affects borrowers in rural or semi-urban areas\u2014places where physical access to vendors is unreliable, and internet connectivity is patchy. With ZOOP, NBFCs can now complete legally binding agreements remotely, giving first-time borrowers faster access to critical funds.This aligns with India\u2019s broader fintech evolution, where eKYC, eSign, and now eStamping are forming the backbone of a fully digital credit infrastructure.A blueprint for global markets  While ZOOP is currently focused on India, its model is drawing attention from industry observers in emerging markets across Southeast Asia and Africa, where paper-heavy legal processes remain a challenge.  This isn\u2019t just about speed, It\u2019s about building trust, transparency, and accessibility into the lending process. If India can digitize stamp duty without waiting for legacy infrastructure to catch up, so can other economies.  As regulators, lenders, and fintech players worldwide seek faster, auditable, and consumer-friendly workflows, ZOOP\u2019s eStamping platform may well serve as a blueprint for the next wave of global digitization in legal documentation.

Nationally, the middle class spans incomes from $51,813 to $155,438.By the same measure, San Jose, California, has the highest middle-class income range of the largest U.S. cities. The city's median household income is $136,229 \u2014 nearly double the national median of $77,719. That means middle-class residents in San Jose earn between $90,819 and $272,458 per year.Large cities like San Jose and New York are economic hubs with a high concentration of high-paying jobs in sectors such as tech, finance and professional services, which is part of why median incomes tend to be higher in these places. But higher earnings are often offset by steep living costs \u2014 especially for housing.And while earning $100,000 has long been seen as a milestone, in a city like San Jose it puts a household at the lower end of the local middle-class range.  For residents, that might help explain why earning six figures doesn't feel like it stretches as far as it once did.Here's how much you'd need to earn to be considered middle class in each of the 15 largest U.S. cities, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data, which adjusts all income to 2023 dollars, ranked from the highest to lowest median income.1.

{"instruction": "Does the article content match the title?", "input": "Title: Bitcoin becoming 'more central\u2019 to portfolios as its volatility cools, Coatue's Philippe Laffont says\nContent: Philippe Laffont, founder and chief investment officer of Coatue Management LLC.Chris Goddney | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhile investors may have been put off by bitcoin's volatility in its early years, a few factors are emerging that will make the flagship crypto a key part of a portfolio, according to Coatue Management's Philippe Laffont.The founder of the tech-focused hedge fund spoke Thursday at Coinbase's State of Crypto Summit in New York City.For starters, while bitcoin has managed to surge nearly 13% in 2025, Laffont said that the cryptocurrency's volatility has come down over time. Bitcoin's dramatic price swings have been a deterrent for potential investors in the crypto \u2013 and at one point, this volatility kept Coatue from getting into bitcoin, he said.\"It's intriguing to me that maybe \u2026 the cost of getting into bitcoin is shrinking,\" Laffont said on stage Thursday at Coinbase's State of Crypto Summit in New York City. \"If the beta shrinks, that would be very interesting.\" Beta is a measurement of an asset's volatility compared to the that of the market.Institutional investors' move to embrace bitcoin was also a sign of maturity for the cryptocurrency, he said. Consider that BlackRock was one of the leaders of the charge to bring bitcoin ETFs to market.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin via Coin Metrics over the past yearFurther, Laffont pointed out bitcoin's performance in 2022 and how it has changed over time. The flagship cryptocurrency fell more than 60% in 2022, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 33%. In contrast, from April 2 to April 10 \u2014 the days following the announcement of President Donald Trump's tariffs \u2014 bitcoin retreated about 5% and the Nasdaq fell more than 6%.Additionally, the number of\u00a0bitcoin\u00a0wallets that have held the\u00a0crypto\u00a0for at least a month and sell their full position has come down \"a lot,\" Laffont said, which suggests investors are holding onto the\u00a0crypto\u00a0for the long term rather than trading it.Bitcoin accounts for a small amount of the world's net worth \u2013 about $2 trillion out of $500 trillion, he said. If one assumes bitcoin will continue to grow and be seen as valuable by more people, then it \"has to become more central\" to a portfolio, Laffont said.Nightly regretsCoatue has invested in private and public crypto companies like data provider Dune Analytics, bitcoin miner Hut 8 and artificial intelligence play CoreWeave. The latter company has a partnership with bitcoin miner Core Scientific. The bitcoin opportunity wasn't immediately clear to Laffont, however.\"Every night, I wake up at about three in the morning and I go, 'What an idiot. Why didn't I invest more in bitcoin?'\" he said.Laffont described his investment philosophy as one that emphasizes the importance of simple, \"obvious\" ideas over \"complicated\" ones. While crypto market participants have deliberated over the use cases and potential of the cryptocurrency for years, Laffont said he overlooked the simplest aspect of all.\"That \u2026 as long as other people think it's valuable, it gets more valuable over time \u2013 and that's what we missed,\" he said. \"Now I go back and I say, this is crazy \u2013 why wouldn't everyone have one or two or 3% or 4% of your assets in something like bitcoin that \u2026 protects you against inflation?\"'The dying population'Laffont identified three cohorts of his client base: those who are hands off and leave the investing to him, those wondering \"why did you miss one of the biggest trends in the world,\" and the risk-averse ones who feel comfortable \"as long as you don't dabble in crypto.\"The latter \"is the dying population,\" Laffont said. \"Every year there's a little bit less of them. That's the spectrum that you get from institutional investors. Hopefully, we see that distribution continue to change.\"While Laffont has become more of a bitcoin enthusiast than he used to be, he still told summit attendees not to get carried away and to approach the cryptocurrency with basic investing principles.\"For those of you that think bitcoin is going to be important, my recommendation is never make it such a big portion of your portfolio that it becomes the driving factor of the portfolio,\" he said. \"You're going to make way more money by having a smaller position that you can keep for 10 years than the big one that worries you all the time.\"", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "28g3fy14e4wzf6j", "date": "2025-06-14 13:17:16.000Z"}}
{"instruction": "Does the article content match the title?", "input": "Title: A family of 4 needs over $300,000 a year to live comfortably in this state\u2014it's not Hawaii or California\nContent: Many American families are increasingly struggling to keep up with the cost of living in most of the 50 U.S. states.\u00a0The U.S. median household income rose between 2022 and 2023 to just over $80,000 a year, according to the most recent Census Bureau data. But a family of four needs at least $186,618 a year to live comfortably in Mississippi in 2025, the country's most affordable state, found a SmartAsset study that published on June 4.\"Living comfortably\" means having enough income to dedicate 50% to necessary costs, 30% to discretionary wants and 20% to debt payments and saving, also known as following the 50/30/20 budget, according to the study.In Massachusetts, the most expensive state in the U.S., a family of four needs more than $300,000 per year to meet that threshold. Costs of living grew by over 4% in that state from 2024, slightly more than the national average of 3.87%, SmartAsset's analysis found.\u00a0Boston has the highest cost of raising a child in the country, a separate SmartAsset study recently found, and much of that total cost comes from child care. Raising a child in Boston costs an estimated $39,221 per year, including $23,800 just for child care, according to SmartAsset.Having children typically gives families other added costs, too: food, supplies and, in some instances, increased housing costs.The cost of living for families in other states may not be quite as high as in Massachusetts, but three states \u2014 Vermont, New Jersey and Montana \u2014 are on track to rapidly catch up, with double-digit growth rates from 2024, found SmartAsset's report.On the flip side, overall costs of living actually shrank from 2024 in six states, the report said: Hawaii, New York, Georgia, Delaware, Michigan and Iowa.SmartAsset used the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's living wage calculator to estimate the annual cost of essentials in each state. MIT calculates family living costs for two working adults and two children and includes essentials like housing and food for all those family members as well as child care.Here's the income it takes for families of four to live comfortably in all 50 states in 2025, according to the study:AlabamaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $194,522Change from 2024: 0.47%AlaskaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $259,002Change from 2024: 6.76%ArizonaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $237,952Change from 2024: 3.17%ArkansasIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $193,773Change from 2024: 7.18%CaliforniaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $287,456Change from 2024: 3.88%ColoradoIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $273,728Change from 2024: 3.30%ConnecticutIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $290,368Change from 2024: 3.75%DelawareIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $223,142Change from 2024: -2.54%FloridaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $217,651Change from 2024: 4.10%GeorgiaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $210,829Change from 2024: -0.94%HawaiiIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $294,362Change from 2024: -0.08%IdahoIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $223,142Change from 2024: 5.63%IllinoisIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $234,291Change from 2024: 1.00%IndianaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $220,230Change from 2024: 6.91%IowaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $202,675Change from 2024: -4.13%KansasIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $200,678Change from 2024: 1.99%KentuckyIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $192,941Change from 2024: 1.49%LouisianaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $199,597Change from 2024: 5.27%MaineIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $239,699Change from 2024: 4.42%MarylandIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $259,168Change from 2024: 8.23%MassachusettsIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $313,747Change from 2024: 4.17%MichiganIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $207,584Change from 2024: -3.22%MinnesotaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $251,264Change from 2024: 2.65%MississippiIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $186,618Change from 2024: 4.96%MissouriIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $218,317Change from 2024: 7.94%MontanaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $234,957Change from 2024: 11.14%NebraskaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $215,738Change from 2024: 1.25%NevadaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $238,534Change from 2024: 0.53%New HampshireIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $259,501Change from 2024: 6.31%New JerseyIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $282,714Change from 2024: 12.55%New MexicoIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $220,813Change from 2024: 8.28%New YorkIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $276,973Change from 2024: -0.72%North CarolinaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $210,746Change from 2024: 0.68%North DakotaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $207,334Change from 2024: 2.55%OhioIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $220,563Change from 2024: 5.37%OklahomaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $208,749Change from 2024: 7.54%OregonIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $261,914Change from 2024: 1.78%PennsylvaniaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $248,435Change from 2024: 7.80%Rhode IslandIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $256,672Change from 2024: 2.97%South CarolinaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $208,333Change from 2024: 3.77%South DakotaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $197,933Change from 2024: 2.76%TennesseeIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $200,678Change from 2024: 2.51%TexasIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $204,922Change from 2024: 1.78%UtahIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $231,046Change from 2024: 5.75%VermontIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $286,790Change from 2024: 15.48%VirginiaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $241,696Change from 2024: 2.76%WashingtonIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $277,888Change from 2024: 7.95%West VirginiaIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $195,354Change from 2024: 3.16%WisconsinIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $225,555Change from 2024: 0.22%WyomingIncome needed for a four-person family, 2025: $209,914Change from 2024: 3.19%Are you ready to buy a house?

The 37-year-old British national had travelled back home for Eid-ul-Adha (Bakrid) and to visit his ailing mother. But their life was cut short on Thursday, 12 June.In what has been called India's worst aviation disaster in the last decade or so, at least 270 bodies have been recovered from the deadly Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad. Among them were Ali, his wife Maryam and their two children, Amina (4) and Zain (5). Their family was among the 53 British nationals who were onboard the London-bound Air India plane.Relatives of Javed, much like the other families, are now anxiously waiting to hear back for the DNA results at Kasauti Bhawan in BJ Medical college, Ahmedabad. Ali's family submitted the samples and the forms for the DNA results on the day the camp was set up for the families \u2014 12 June.But they have been told to wait for 72 hours, which seems all too long for the families, an endless wait. Till the time the central or the state government does not declare any action, they won't do much. The administration want the families and friends of the victims to leave eventually. After 72 hours, they will release bodies one by one. This way, they won't be any pressure or blame on the government.Ayub Sheikh, Javed Ali's uncle to The Quint'Their Skin Was Peeling Off\u2026': How Air India Crash Upended Meghani NagarSheikh stated that his nephew, Ali was working in hotel management sector in Britain. \"He only came home for Eid holidays for 6 days and to visit his ailing mother who has a heart problem,\" he told The Quint.At the end of the six-day trip, Ali booked the tickets and was prepared to return to his home. Now, a week after Eid, Javed Ali and his family are no more.Air India 171, which had 242 people on board, including 10 crew members and two pilots, crashed just 32 seconds after taking off from the Ahmedabad airport. There was only survivor, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh.Many families now wait for the DNA results to confirm the bodies of their loved ones. Ghulam Rasool Patel, another uncle of Ali said the 72-hour wait has vexed the families.The 72 hours is spinning in our heads now. We can't stop thinking about when this 72 hours will end. They should have had the technical support and mechanism to not handle this so carelessly. And so many journalists who came here didn't even know which flight this was or where it was headed to. The kind of questions they are asking, it's a menace for the families.Ghulam Rasool Patel, Javed's unlce to The QuintPatel noted that the huge crowd of media-persons has not been asking the questions they should in critical situations like these.\"The media should be asking, how many bodies have been recovered? How many were men and women? What about the other bodies stuck? How did the engine stop? It's an airplane, not a toy. There is either a conspiracy or the authorities were being irresponsible. These are the questions that need to be asked,\" he added.Talking about Ali, Patel said that his nephew was \"trying to build an empire\" in Britain but everything got over in the blink of an eye.\"He studied in Britain and got his citizenship there, so did his wife. They had small children and had recently bought a home there. Their life had just barely started and it got over,\" Patel told The Quint.Even though they have been given the assurance of two-three days, Ali's family stated that the doctors and the staff is not giving them latest updates or more details to calm the agitated and worried families.The Aviation Ministry said on Saturday, 14 June that the pilots of this London-bound Air India flight AI-171 had sent one radio message to Air Traffic Control at 1:39 PM.Two days later, dozens of anxious family members, like Ali's, wait outside the Ahmedabad hospital to collect bodies of their loved ones, as doctors work overtime to run identification checks and DNA profiling.Ahmedabad: Tea Vendor's Child Sleeping on Road Killed in Air India Plane Crash(At The Quint, we question everything.

(Archives of similar claims can be found here and here.) Is the claim true?: No, the claim is false. The video has been created using artificial intelligence (AI).Did Congress Launch Former ISI Chief Asad Durrani\u2019s Book? Claim Is Misleading!What we found: At first, we used a virtual private network (VPN) for our searches.We divided the video into multiple screenshots and ran a Google reverse image search on some of them. We came across the same video on TikTok by a page called 'miniverse productions.' It was uploaded on 21 April, which predates the current tensions between Israel and Iran.Additionally, the user labelled the video as 'AI-generated', noting that it did not show a real incident.  Similarly, the reverse image search results led us to a post on X which reposted the video and said, \"This is an AI video that was created months ago.\"We also found several comments under posts featuring the viral about which noted that the video was, 'fake' or 'AI.' Swipe right to see the claims. Additionally, we did not find any credible reports to prove whether Iran had destroyed Israel's air defence system.Whats happening between Iran-Israel: Israel initiated 'Operation Rising Lion,' focusing on Iranian nuclear sites and military resources. Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that this is a crucial moment for the survival of Israel. In retaliation, Iranian missiles have struck multiple locations in Israel, resulting in the deaths of at least three individuals and injuring many others, as a response to continued Israeli assaults on Iran. According to Iran, Israeli attacks have resulted in the deaths of at least 78 people, including women and children, and have injured over 320 more, as the Israeli forces persist in their attacks on urban areas, military installations, and nuclear sites, reported Al Jazeera. Conclusion: An old, AI-generated clip went viral as Iran attacking Israel's air defence system.

(Archives of similar claims can be found here and here.) Is the claim true?: No, the claim is false as this image is edited. The original one is from Scotland and dates back to 2011. It does not feature a damaged aircraft in it.AI-Generated Image Viral as Real Visuals of Air India Plane Crash in AhmedabadWhat we found: We ran a Google reverse image search on the image and found a report by The Guardian from 2012. It contained a similar image as the viral one. The report noted, \"A wind turbine bursts into flames as storms tear across Scotland. Photograph: Stuart McMahon/Universal News and Sport\" (sic.) The report discussed the impact of the fierce winds that hit Scotland on 8 December 2011, which caused significant damage and disruption to the country's energy infrastructure. It spoke about the wind turbine at the Ardrossan wind farm which caught fire and became a defining image of the storm. We compared the two visuals and found similarities.However, the only contention was the absence of the design of the plane in the original.This hinted that the image was edited. We ran the image on Fake News Detector and it noted that it was \"computer generated or modified.\" Additionally, we also found the original image in a report by The Telegraph in 2011 which also noted about the wind turbine catching fire in hurricane-force winds at Ardrossan. Conclusion: An old image from 2011 showing a wind turbine on fire has gone viral to falsely claim that it shows the plane crash in Ahmedabad. However, this image has been edited further to manipulate users.

But she first attained public recognition and wealth as a child actor \u2014 playing the titular character on the Disney Channel's TV show, \"Hannah Montana.\" The show first aired in 2006, when Cyrus was 13 years old, and ran until 2011.Cyrus' affinity for high-end fashion hasn't gone away: In December, she purchased a vintage Bob Mackie dress at auction that was previously estimated to sell for up to $8,000, according to the Hollywood Reporter. (The actual price Cyrus paid remains undisclosed.)Clothing is a popular choice among newly minted celebrities, looking to spend their first big paycheck. NFL star Travis Kelce spent around $10,000 on a limited edition pair of Nike Air MAGs, he said on his \"New Heights\" podcast, in an episode that aired in May 2023.\"Saturday Night Live\" star Bowen Yang bought a pair of Gucci shoes with his first paycheck from the TV show, he told New York magazine in a video published on Dec. 4. \"The kind that everyone got, and the kind I wouldn't feel super cool wearing out now,\" Yang said.DON'T MISS:\u00a0A step-by-step guide to buying your first home\u2014and avoiding costly mistakesOther high-profile first big-money purchases include homes, sometimes for family members, or cars. Retired NBA star Shaquille O'Neal did both: He spent his first $1 million within hours on paying off his mom's house, three Mercedes Benzes \u2014 for himself, his dad and his mom \u2014 and \"rings and diamonds and earrings,\" he told Business Insider in November 2017.If you ever receive a windfall of money \u2014 whether that's winning the lottery or landing a job with a major pay raise \u2014 don't be hasty, financial experts advise.

{"instruction": "Does the article content match the title?", "input": "Title: I have 5 income streams and make over $1 million from Amazon alone: 5 books that helped me reinvent\u2014and keep going\nContent: I had no idea what I was doing in 2018, when I launched my Amazon business, selling card games that help people develop emotional intelligence skills.\u00a0At the time, I had two part-time jobs, was getting a full-time master's degree at Harvard, and was raising three young kids. I had to squeeze in my side hustle alongside all my other obligations.\u00a0Just as I gained traction, a few years later, bringing in over $1.7M a year in sales, the economy shifted, consumer habits changed, and competition grew. The number of card games on the market surged while consumers tightened their wallets in response to economic uncertainty. I didn't give up. Instead, I was able to adapt and find even greater success than I anticipated.Today, I have five income streams (and counting). I've learned that the real work in building wealth isn't just about starting, it's about staying in the game through ongoing reinvention.\u00a0Markets have cycles. Many side hustles have expiration dates. The mental game of entrepreneurship depends on your ability to stay agile, adaptive and resilient in the face of uncertainty.These five books didn't just help me get started. They've helped me evolve, recalibrate, and keep going.1. 'The Algebra of Wealth: A Simple Formula for Financial Security' by Scott GallowayIf you want to build lasting wealth, you need a framework for making smart, strategic decisions. In this book, academic and entrepreneur Scott Galloway breaks down four key variables for financial security: discipline, stoicism, time and diversification.This playbook pushed me to ask not just what I can do, but what's truly worth doing with my limited time and energy. It helped me reevaluate how I weigh risks, spot opportunities, and make trade-offs across my income streams.Whether you're working toward your first six figures or scaling your next income stream, this book offers pragmatic action items to help you build better financial habits and make more informed decisions.2. 'Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts' by Annie DukeOne of the hardest parts of starting and running a business is making decisions without all the facts. In \"Thinking in Bets,\" Annie Duke \u2014 a former professional poker player turned decision strategist \u2014 teaches readers how to evaluate their choices by thinking in probabilities, not certainties.This book taught me to separate luck from skill, and outcome from process. Just because a decision didn't work out, doesn't mean it was the wrong call. And just because a decision worked, it doesn't mean it was a smart move.\u00a0That perspective shift gave me the clarity to take bolder risks, grounded in logic, rather than emotion.Her \"thinking in bets\" framework encouraged me to ask myself: What are the odds this will work? What's the downside if it doesn't? This helped me navigate uncertainty with more confidence and fewer regrets.3. 'Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Essential Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger' by Charles MungerThis book is a master class in long-term thinking, rational decision-making, and investing. It compiles eleven of the late Charlie Munger's most influential talks.Munger, known for his enduring work with his long-time friend Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway, was renowned for his multidisciplinary approach to decision-making.\u00a0I appreciated how this book taught me how to think, not just what to think. I learned to apply the principles of psychology, economics and engineering to make better decisions in business and in life.One of his signature ideas, \"invert, always invert,\" taught me to examine problems from the opposite angle. This mindset has helped me to work through complex dilemmas and mental roadblocks. I still revisit this book to sharpen my thinking when the path forward feels uncertain.4. 'Ego is the Enemy' by Ryan HolidayEvery business moves through phases of ascent, plateau and decline. Author Ryan Holiday shows how unchecked ego can sabotage success at every stage \u2014 whether you're turning a profit, becoming a viral sensation or facing tough setbacks.Through historical examples and personal anecdotes, Holiday explores how ego clouds our judgment, resists feedback and blinds us to our shortcomings. In my keynote speeches on emotional intelligence, I often emphasize the same idea to leaders and teams I talk to: self-awareness is your edge.This book helped normalize the highs and lows I've experienced as a founder and creator. It also gave me foresight into the potential scenarios I might face in the future. Most of all, it reminded me to be clear-eyed, grounded, and vigilant about not being influenced by an undue sense of self-importance.5. 'The Next Day: Transitions, Change, and Moving Forward' by Melinda French GatesHow do we know when it's time to change course? This book explores that exact question, and reminds us to pause and listen to our inner voice over the noise around us.Transitions in business and life often go hand in hand. They bring discomfort, uncertainty, and the temptation to rush through the hard parts. But \"the next day\" after a big decision is when we begin to consciously choose what to carry forward and what to leave behind.This book has provided comfort and clarity, and helped me navigate both personal and professional shifts. It reminds me that starting over is still forward motion, and the way that I handle change can shape everything that comes next.Dr. Jenny Woo is a Harvard-trained educator, EQ speaker, investor and the founder and CEO of Mind Brain Emotion.

And then Pilates, making sure I go.\"A decade ago, Lohan moved to Dubai for a reset. There, she met her husband, Bader Shammas, and in 2023, had her son, Luai. Around that time, she'd just ended a long break from acting. Though she's constantly back and forth from her home overseas to New York and Los Angeles, she tries to keep the same routine.\"It's hard in L.A. Even taking my son to the park in L.A., I get stressed,\" said Lohan, 38. \"It's all about balance and, as I said, routine. Especially when you have a kid, routine is the most important thing. And whatever their routine is, I've got to live by that.\"Her commitment to self-care and having a consistent morning regimen, she added, came from a lesson from her co-star and work mom, Jamie Lee Curtis, who taught her \"to always take care of yourself first. Because without that, how can you do everything for everyone else?\"Experts like bestselling author and personal growth expert Mel Robbins tend to agree with Curtis' advice. Robbins learned the lesson firsthand unintentionally after not paying attention to her own mental health early in parenthood. That seemed to lead to increased stress and anxiety in her child.The \"single best thing\" parents can do is to get ahead of those issues early, she said on a May 6 episode of \"The Oprah Podcast.\"The benefits of an intentional morning routineStarting your day with mindfulness, physical activity or time with your kids \u2014 as opposed to checking your emails or calendar \u2014 can boost your happiness and fulfillment, experts say. Journaling every morning, as Lohan does, can have a real impact: Just 15 minutes a day can help you clarify your thoughts and feelings, improve your problem solving skills and even help you recover from trauma, bestselling authors Deepak Chopra and Kabir Sehgal wrote for CNBC Make It in July 2019.Putting pen to paper at least three to five days a week could significantly improve your physical and mental health, they said. They recommended reflecting on topics like advice you'd give your younger self, or 10 things you wish other people knew about you.\"If you're new to journaling, the easiest way to begin is to find a time and place where you won't be disturbed, and just start writing,\" they wrote.Dedicating a portion of your morning to having fun is important too, says psychologist Laura Pendergrass, who advises Fortune 500 companies.\"Self-care in the form of fun is just as important as anything else we do to take care of ourselves,\" she said in 2022. \"We recognize the importance of recess for kids and build it into their school time, but we forget the importance of play as adults. It's up to us to create our own enrichment opportunities to do something fun or creative and inject color into what could otherwise be a gray day.\"Are you ready to buy a house?

Here's what investors are keeping an eye on next\nContent: Gap is making a comeback.The brand reported 5% same-store sales growth for its fiscal first quarter of 2025. Its the sixth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth.Gap was one of the most popular retail names of the 1980s and 1990s, but fell out of favor among consumers at the start of the new millennium. From fiscal 2001 to 2021, the brand closed about 2,000 stores and annual sales fell by about $3.5 billion.Despite multiple turnaround attempts from a revolving door of CEOs, the company couldn't sustain momentum.\"They would have a couple quarters where things looked like they were doing well. They would over buy the inventory, then they would promote it. Then promoting kills the brand equity,\" said Barclays senior retail analyst Adrienne Yih. \"The brands weren't strong enough to drive full price selling, so they were always on promo.\"In 2023, CEO Richard Dickson took the helm of Gap, which owns its namesake banner, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta. Dickson came from toymaker Mattel where he is largely credited for the revival of the Barbie brand. One of Dickson's first moves at the apparel retailer was hiring fashion designer Zac Posen as the company's creative director.\u00a0\u00a0Posen has helped to put Gap back into the cultural conversation by dressing celebrities like Demi Moore, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Anne Hathaway and Laura Harrier for splashy red carpet events. However, Posen's main focus is on the Old Navy brand where he serves as chief creative officer.\u00a0Re-energizing Old Navy is important because it accounts for more than half of Gap's revenue. In fiscal 2024, Gap grew overall sales by 1%, driven mostly by growth at Old Navy. While that may seem nominal, its underlying business is more profitable.\"They are growing that 1% on the highest gross margins that they have had in the past 20 years. When you finally do grow sales, you want to grow it in an extraordinarily high profit generating and healthy manner,\" said Yih.In order to get back to growth, Gap had to shrink first. The company closed hundreds of stores over the past decade and laid off thousands of employees in 2023 as it worked to clean up its balance sheet.\"We had unprofitable stores, unprofitable markets, where we did store closures. We moved international businesses to partners, joint ventures,\" said Gap brand president and CEO Mark Breitbard. \"We consolidated our SKUs, we rationalized styles, improved quality dramatically. So all of those things, including some things like reducing costs, which are key to making a business healthy but not fun. Those were setting up a foundation for us to layer on a creative renaissance, really, for the brand.\"Still, there's more work to be done.\u00a0Banana Republic and Athleta are not seeing the same consistency in same-store sales growth as Gap and Old Navy. While smaller brands, together they accounted for more than 20% of company-wide net sales in fiscal 2024.Plus, uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariff policies has created a challenging retail landscape. Despite beating Wall Street's earnings expectations for its fiscal first-quarter report, Gap saw its stock fall 15% on news that tariffs, if they remain in place as is, would cost the company between $100 million and $150 million.Watch the video to find out if the Gap renaissance is here to stay.", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "su44659b0mo005x", "date": "2025-06-14 12:00:01.000Z"}}
{"instruction": "Does the article content match the title?", "input": "Title: This credit card behavior is an under-the-radar risk: 'Be very careful,' expert says\nContent: Olga Rolenko | Moment | Getty ImagesThere are all sorts of ways for consumers to misuse credit cards, from failing to pay monthly bills in full to running up your balance. But here's one risky behavior that experts say you likely haven't heard of: \"credit cycling.\"Credit cards come with a spending limit. Cardholders are usually aware of this limit, which represents the overall cap to how much they can borrow. The limit resets with each billing statement when users pay their bill in full and on time.Users who credit-cycle will reach that limit and quickly pay down their balance; this frees up more headroom so consumers can effectively charge beyond their typical allowance.Doing this occasionally is usually not a big deal, experts said. It's akin to driving a few miles per hour over the speed limit \u2014 something less likely to get a driver pulled over for speeding, said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com.But consistently \"churning\" through available credit comes with risks, Rossman said.watch nowFor example, card issuers may cancel a user's card and take away their reward points, experts said. This might negatively impact a user's credit score, they said.\"If there's even the slightest chance credit cycling can go sideways, it's best not to do it and look for alternatives,\" said Bruce McClary, senior vice president at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. \"You have to be very careful.\"Card companies see credit cycling as a riskThe average American's credit card limit was about $34,000 at the end of the second quarter of 2024, according to Experian, one the three major credit bureaus. (This was the limit across all their cards.)The amount varies across generations, and according to factors like income and credit usage, according to Experian.It's understandable why some consumers would want to credit cycle, experts said.More from Personal Finance:Why summer Fridays are increasingly rareHow GOP megabill affects families with kidsWhat a Trump, Powell showdown means for your moneyCertain consumers may have a relatively low credit limit, and credit cycling might help them pay for a big-ticket purchase like a home repair, wedding or a costly vacation, experts said. Others may do it to accelerate the rewards and points they get for making purchases, they said.But card issuers would likely see repeat offenders as a red flag, Rossman said.watch nowMaxing out a card frequently may run afoul of certain terms and conditions, or signal that a user is experiencing financial difficulty and struggling to stay within their budget, he said.Issuers may also view it as a potential sign of illegal activity like money laundering, he said.\"You could be putting yourself at risk by appearing to be a risk in that way,\" McClary said.Credit cycling consequencesIf a card issuer penalizes a credit-cycling customer by closing their account, it could have negative repercussions for their credit score, experts said.Credit utilization is the share of one's outstanding debt relative to their credit limit. Keeping utilization relatively low generally helps boost one's credit score, while a high rate generally hurts it, McClary said.Experts generally recommend keeping credit utilization below 30%, and below 10% if you really want to improve your credit score.A canceled card would reduce one's overall credit limit, raising the odds that a user's credit utilization rate would increase if they have outstanding debt on other credit cards, McClary said.Further, a card company could flag misuse as a reason for the account closure, potentially making the user look like more of a risk to future creditors, he added.Consistently butting up against one's credit limit also increases the chances of accidentally breaching that threshold, McClary said. Doing so could lead creditors to charge over-limit fees or raise a user's interest rate, he said.Consumers who credit-cycle should be cognizant of any recurring monthly subscriptions or other charges that might inadvertently push them over the limit, he said.What to do insteadInstead of credit cycling, consumers may be better served by asking their card issuer for a higher credit limit, opening a new credit card account or spreading payments over more than one card, Rossman said.As a general practice, Rossman is a \"big fan\" of paying down one's credit card bill early, such as in the middle of the billing cycle instead of waiting for the end. (To be clear, this isn't the same as credit cycling, since consumers wouldn't be paying down their balance early in order to spend beyond their allotted credit.)This can reduce a consumer's credit utilization rate \u2014 and boost one's credit score \u2014 since card balances are generally only reported to the credit bureaus at the end of the monthly billing cycle, he said.\"It can be a good way to improve your score, especially if you use your card a lot,\" he said.", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "61gj9qy80393ph1", "date": "2025-06-14 10:30:01.000Z"}}

The strait last effectively closed during the Iran-Iraq \"Tanker War\" in 1984, and remains a critical transit point for global oil and gas shipments, which led to a surge in the price of crude on Friday.But the Strait of Hormuz is also key for global container trade. The ports in this region (Jebel Ali and Khor Fakkan) are transshipment hubs. The majority of cargo volumes from these ports are destined for Dubai, which has become a hub for the movement of freight with feeder services in the Persian Gulf, South Asia, and East Africa.In a threat circular, British maritime security firm Ambrey advised companies and vessels to prepare rerouting of high-risk transits following military strikes. \"In the event of escalation, merchant vessels are advised to reconsider transiting through the Strait of Hormuz and close to Iranian waters, as well as to seek drifting locations close to friendly and protected territorial waters,\" Ambrey wrote.It also recommended vessel owners and operators to check the affiliation of vessels as part of risk assessment to see if there is any Israel connection before their Arabian Sea, Gulf of Oman, and Persian/Arabian Gulf voyages.\u00a0Vessels with affiliation or past affiliation with Israel have led to targeting of the ships in the past.BIMCO has advised ship owners to implement ship defense measures outlined in industry documents, report suspicious sightings to the UK's Maritime Trade Operations, reconsider current routing, and keep seafarer safety in mind, are among the recommendations it has shared with clients.Larsen said any perception of the United States' involvement will bring greater risks for ships, though so far the U.S. has limited its comments in relation to the strikes, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio describing Israel's actions as \"unilateral,\" and saying on Thursday night \"Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.\"The U.S. said it was helping Israel to shoot down missiles fired into Israel on Friday. \"If the United States is suddenly perceived to be involved in attacks, the risk of escalation increases significantly,\" he said. \"An escalation is likely to impact freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf/Straits of Hormuz. Such an escalation could include missile attacks on ships or laying of sea mines in the Straits.\"The US-led Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) said on Friday that the Strait of Hormuz remains open and commercial traffic continues to flow uninterrupted, and added it has \"no indications of an increased threat to the maritime environment.\"\u00a0The JMIC is urging companies to review contingency plans for routing, crew welfare, and emergency response in the event of a significant regional escalation when transiting the Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and Northern Arabian Sea.Greece, which has a history of Greek-owned tankers being seized by Iran, is also warning its Greek ship owners and operators to send details of their transits through the Strait of Hormuz.In an email to CNBC, data and analytics firm Kpler said it is keeping an eye on any vessel diversions, but it remains too early to detect any changes since Israel's attacks.Recent maritime safety practices in the Red Sea indicate that ship owners are wary of the region, with freight ship diversions ever since the Houthi attacks, despite the longer transit times and a 15% discount in containership fees offered by the Suez Canal to entice ocean carriers to return to previous routes. Suez Canal traffic is down 60% from pre-Houthi attack levels.The maritime industry has been avoiding the Middle East even amid hopes of a truce and with Houthis saying they are not attacking ships, but Israel's strikes have put those hopes of a return to normal Red Sea shipping on hold. \"A large-scale return of container ships to the Red Sea seem less likely, a situation which continues to have a major impact on ocean container shipping rates 18 months after Iran-backed Houthi militia in Yemen began attacking vessels in the region,\" said Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst at Xeneta.Insurance on ships, cargo and crew is likely to be hiked by underwriters, according to Sand.\"The inevitable disruption and port congestion, as well as the potential for higher oil prices, would cause a spike in ocean freight container shipping rates, with carriers likely also pushing for a 'security surcharge' on these trades in the coming days,\" Sand added.", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "s9bw4018mhv2b26", "date": "2025-06-13 18:24:58.000Z"}}

It separates your business finances from your personal ones and is what you'll use for all of your small business's transactions.\u00a0Many business accounts offer online banking and other features \u2014 like payroll management, business loans, and merchant services \u2014 specifically for businesses.When should you open a small business bank account?If you're already receiving or plan to receive any payments as a solopreneur or small business owner, then it's the right time to open a business bank account. This account is where you'll deposit all of your business income and pay for all of your business expenses.Ideally, you'll open your dedicated bank account as one of your first steps when setting up your new business. But if you've already been running your business and accepting payments, rest assured that it's not too late to open an account and separate your finances as you move forward.One thing to keep in mind here: If you're in the process of establishing a business entity, wait until you've completed that process. You'll need your business name and potentially your business registration paperwork when you open your bank account.Why should you open a small business bank account?Do you absolutely need a small business bank account? Not necessarily. If you're running your business as a sole proprietor (meaning you haven't established a formal business entity), a separate bank account is more of a strong recommendation than a firm requirement.\u00a0But even so, if you're receiving any business income, it's generally a smart idea to have a dedicated bank account specifically for your small business \u2014 even if you aren't technically required to do so. Setting up a separate bank account helps you:Separate your personal and business finances, which is especially important if you have an established business entity like an LLCSimplify your bookkeeping, financial record-keeping, and tax preparationGet a better understanding of your income, expenses, and cash flowDemonstrate professionalism and present your business as more legitimateEstablish and build business creditAccept credit card payments from customers, which isn't easy to do with most personal bank accountsQualify for and receive small business loans and grantsYou may want to look for a bank account that automates accounting, like Mercury*, which can make your day-to-day much more efficient.Subscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!Money matters \u2014\u00a0so make the most of it.

These types of accounts serve distinct purposes, similar to your personal checking and savings accounts.Your checking account is what you'll use for day-to-day transactions, like receiving payments from your customers or running payroll for your employees.Your savings account is where you'll build a financial buffer for your business. Business savings accounts generally offer a higher interest rate than checking accounts, making them a great spot for growing your funds over a longer period of time.In most cases, you'll need a business checking account to handle your daily\u00a0business activities. But it's smart to also open a savings account so you have a specific spot where you can set money aside.What do you need to open a small business bank account?If you're picturing long lines at the bank and piles of paperwork, you'll be pleasantly surprised. These days, opening a separate bank account for your business is pretty straightforward \u2014 and many financial institutions allow you to do so online.Start by picking your bank. You can check if the institution you use for your personal banking also offers business banking, evaluate online-only business bank accounts, or open a business checking account with a different bank or credit union than the one you currently use. As you consider your options, pay attention to service fees or any requirements for monthly transactions or minimum balances.To open your account, you'll need to complete a simple application and provide your:Social Security Number or Employer Identification Number (EIN)Personal identification (like a valid driver's license)Business registration paperwork, if applicable (such as the articles of incorporation you filed for your LLC)You might also need proof of your address or other paperwork, and some banks also require a small initial deposit. Check with your chosen bank to make sure you have everything you need to open an account.Separate finances for a smarter businessOpening a small business bank account separates your personal finances from your business ones. But it also provides a clear place to manage your money, make smarter decisions, and set yourself up to achieve every business owner's ultimate goal: a long, successful future.* Mercury is a financial technology company, not a bank.

She now works from a combination cobbler-and-coffee shop called Cobbler Bushwick Roaster, which she co-opened in January with two business partners.As a cobbler, Roh restores broken-down shoes to their original condition. As an upcycler, she can add creative flair to the repair job by stitching on leather patches or adding a new color of soles. \"Each sneaker has its own story,\" says Roh, 47. \"Sometimes it's a heel, sometimes it's a toe [that's worn out] ... The area that you need to repair, that becomes a design element.\"The upcycling process is tedious, and can take up to 10 hours per pair of shoes, Roh says.\u00a0She charges $350 to $520 for the service, and hosts $680 cobbling workshops for people curious about fixing shoes themselves.DON'T MISS:\u00a0A step-by-step guide to buying your first home\u2014and avoiding costly mistakesCobbler Bushwick Co. brought in just over $37,750 in gross revenue from Jan. 1 through Tuesday, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. It has already outpaced its 2024 financial performance \u2014 it brought in roughly $33,000 in gross revenue last year \u2014 in just six months.The business was profitable in 2024, documents show, with Roh pocketing nearly $9,900 in take-home pay. (Her husband, who works for the U.S. General Services Administration, covers their household expenses, she says.)Running a cobbling and upcycling business is physically exhausting work, says Roh, but not nearly as tiring as doing work she doesn't enjoy. She started Cobbler Bushwick Co. after leaving her vice president job at a shoe design company in 2021, she says.\"I was burned out,\" Roh says. \"I [had to] keep developing similar shoes every season, and that's like an endless cycle.\"The coffee shop and cobbler space within Cobbler Bushwick RoasterCNBC Make ItHer brother, who works as a cobbler in South Korea, suggested that she open her own business, Roh recalls. He visited and taught her his process over the course of two weeks in 2022, and she practiced for another four months before launching her business, she says.Now, she feels more joyful and excited to come to work, she says: \"I get energy from the community ... local people, rather than people I've never seen, [buying shoes in] an online transaction.\"Roh works with two apprentices, cobbling and upcycling shoes four days per week. She works at the coffee shop one additional day per week. The coffee portion of the new store \u2014 primarily run by her business partners, Roh's former colleague Ahram Choi and her husband Seokhoon Choi \u2014 has already brought at least $41,000 in 2025, documents show.Roh owns the entirety of her cobbling business, and 50% of the coffee shop, she says. The coffee business was profitable in May, she adds.Combining two businesses into one storefrontThe jump in sales for Roh's cobbling business corresponds with the opening of Cobbler Bushwick Roaster. Customers at the coffee shop didn't immediately bring in their old shoes while picking up their salted honey lattes, Roh notes \u2014 but she's working to turn them into cobbling customers over time.\"It's not immediate interest to spend,\" says Roh. \"They keep coming back, and they keep seeing the product, and they keep [building] the interest in cobbling. [I hope] it's growing on them.\"To open the storefront, which costs $2,500 in monthly rent to use, the trio of business partners spent about $40,000 on renovations, she says. Roh paid another $5,000 to renovate her cobbling workshop.For her portion of $27,500, Roh cashed out $11,900 from her Roth IRA, according to documents. She also took $3,600 out of her and her husband's savings, put $5,000 on her credit card and borrowed the remaining $7,000 from her sister, she says.\"I'm going to just think [this is like] I'm going to get a master's degree, [so I] need [to invest] the money,\" she says. \"This is an education course.\"The coffee shop element gives Roh a second stream of revenue and helps diversify her income. Even as she works to grow her shoe business, cobbling as a trade is shrinking, says Roh. In 2019, there were 5,000 shoe repair shops in the U.S. \u2014 down from 15,000 in 1997, according to the Associated Press, which cited data from The Shoe Service Institution of America, a trade organization.\"It definitely helps [having] these two businesses together ... it creates a very different energy, like a very positive synergy,\" says Roh, adding: \"If you know how to do more than just cobbling, I think you have a better chance to survive this declining market.\"Are you ready to buy a house?

Loren Elliott  | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesFor the better part of a decade, Amazon has been trying to carve its way into the U.S. health-care market, through billions of dollars worth of acquisitions, big-name hires and high-profile partnerships. It's been a slog at times, and the company's long-term strategy hasn't always been clear.Following a series of executive departures, Amazon is now restructuring its health business, telling CNBC that Amazon Health Services will be divided into six new units, with a goal of creating a simpler structure.As part of the effort, the company has tapped a number of longtime Amazon leaders and elevated some One Medical executives to oversee the divisions.\u00a0Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services told CNBC in an interview that the company has been working on the overhaul for the past several months.\"Our leadership team has been focused on simplifying our structure to move faster and continue to innovate effectively,\" Lindsay said in a video chat. \"One of the problems we're trying to solve is the fragmented experience for patients and customers that's common in healthcare.\"Amazon said it hasn't conducted\u00a0broad layoffs as part of the changes.Read more CNBC tech newsSmall retailers on 'vacation from hell' as they seek clarity on Trump's China tariffsChime's IPO will test public market appetite for fintech as companies line up to exitDisney and Universal sue AI image company Midjourney for unlicensed use of Star Wars, The Simpsons and moreNvidia CEO says quantum computing is reaching an 'inflection point'The reorganization comes after Amazon lost several senior health leaders in recent months. Dr. Vin Gupta, who joined in 2020 and served as chief medical officer of Amazon Pharmacy, left in February, followed by Trent Green, whose last day as CEO of Amazon's primary care chain One Medical was in April.Aaron Martin, vice president of health care at Amazon, announced internally last month that he plans to leave his role. Dr. Sunita Mishra, Amazon's chief medical officer, also departed in May.\u00a0Mishra and Martin's departures have not been previously reported, and neither responded to requests for comment. Amazon doesn't plan on naming a new CEO of One Medical following Green's departure.Martin, who lives in Nashville, Tennessee, said in a memo to staffers that he'll remain at Amazon \"for a while\" to help with the transition.\"I then plan to take some time off this summer and hang out with my wife and my kids, finally get a cover band going in Nashville, and then possibly do something new,\" Martin wrote in the memo, which was shared with CNBC.Ambitious effortsAmazon has for years been on a mission to crack the multitrillion-dollar U.S. health-care industry, which is notoriously complex and inefficient.While it had long served providers and others in health care with its cloud-based technology, Amazon's first big splash directly into the market came in 2018 with the the acquisition of online pharmacy PillPack for about $750 million. Two years later, it launched its own offering called Amazon Pharmacy.The company then bought One Medical for $3.9 billion in 2023, among its largest acquisitions ever, giving Amazon access to a chain of brick-and-mortar primary care clinics and a robust membership base.There have been some major setbacks. The company shuttered its telehealth service, Amazon Care, in 2022. That came a year after it disbanded Haven, the joint health-care venture between Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase.\u00a0The announcement of Haven in 2018 sent shockwaves through the medical world, pushing down shares of health-care companies on fears about how the combined muscle of leaders in technology and finance could wring costs out of the system.watch nowIn the areas where Amazon continues to operate, competition is fierce and, in the case of primary care, margins are very slim.PillPack founders TJ Parker and Elliot Cohen, who left Amazon in 2022, recently launched a new health-care marketplace called General Medicine that will compete with Amazon. Mishra confirmed to STAT News that she advised the nascent startup. Amazon declined to comment on whether Mishra's involvement with General Medicine was related to her departure.\u00a0Lindsay characterized the recent departures as part of the natural evolution of Amazon's health business. He added that there's \"no shortage of depth of talent\" within his organization.\"We're a fast-evolving organization because the opportunity is so big,\" Lindsay said.Under its new structure, Amazon Health Services will be focused around the six groups, or what the company calls \"pillars.\"\u00a0One Medical Clinical Care Delivery, led by Dr. Andrew DiamondOne Medical Clinical Operations and Performance, led by Suzanne HansenAHS Strategic Growth and Network Development, led by John SingerlingAHS Store, Tech and Marketing, led by Prakash BulusuAHS Compliance, led by Kim OtteAHS Pharmacy Services, led by John LoveAmazon declined to share financial figures for its health business, but Lindsay said it is seeing \"very strong growth\" across the offerings.One Medical went public in 2020, and it was still losing money when it was bought by Amazon. At the end of 2022 in its last quarter as a standalone entity, it reported a net loss of $101.1 million on revenue of $272.4 million.Since joining Amazon, One Medical has been working to open new offices in states including New Jersey, New York and Ohio.\u00a0Amazon said in January of 2024 that its pharmacy business \"doubled the number of customers\" it served in the past year, though it didn't share specific figures. The company is opening pharmacies in 20 new cities this year, and about 45% of U.S. customers will be eligible for same-day medication delivery.\"If we can make one thing a little bit easier for a lot of people, we'll save them a lot of time, a lot of money, and some lives,\" Lindsay said. \"And if we stack these changes up over time, it'll feel like a reinvention.\"WATCH: Amazon Pharmacy VP: Trying to make it easier for patients to get medicationwatch now", "output": "true", "meta": {"id": "vgmb7txc97tj61h", "date": "2025-06-13 16:30:01.000Z"}}
